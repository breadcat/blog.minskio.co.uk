This page ties in a little with my [Reading List](/reading-list). I'm in the process (or have been) collecting the [Gollancz SF Masterworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SF_Masterworks#Numbered_series) and reading through the entire collection. I never really set out with the intention of reading every book but when you get over half way through it seems more of 'why not?' type deal.

You're not going to find any reviews here, that could and has been done much better by other people. I'm just tracking progress here.

## Physical Collection
Physically, I have every single book excluding the forever elusive #73 which I've been on the lookout for for quite a number of years now. The re-release pops up nearly daily but the original black spine version, forget about it.

Now the quality varies massively from - *well loved* ex-library copies to pristine never read volumes. At the end of the day though, as far as I'm concerned so long as the words are legible with a bit of squinting I don't especially care and they're popular enough for free digital copies to be in arms reach anyway.

So, on to lists. We all love a good list, right?
