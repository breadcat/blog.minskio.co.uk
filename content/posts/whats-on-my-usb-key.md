I carry around a dinky 64GB Kingston DataTraveler on my keyring for various utilities and operating systems that can save the day.

For multibooting, I generally use [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) and if ever I need to just boot one image, or Ventoy is giving me grief I'll use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/). As for the list, I usually have the following ready to roll:

* [3CX Debian](https://www.3cx.com/docs/manual/installing-debian-linux-pbx/)
* [Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/)
* [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/download/)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst)
* [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/downloads/generic/)
* [netboot](https://netboot.xyz/downloads/)
* [ntpasswd](https://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/)
* [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download)
* [Windows 10 LTSC](https://bobpony.com/downloads/)
