Some time ago, I came across a piece of [LSD blotter art](https://pub.minskio.co.uk/avatars/blotter-albums.jpg) containing some 49 classic psychedelic album covers. I recognised quite a few immediately, but a few stumped me and as a fan of the genres I had to don my deerstalker and have a go at hunting them down. I've had this list for quite a while, but thought it would be interesting to share.
