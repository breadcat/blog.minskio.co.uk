Below is a list of TV shows, movies, books and games that I remember vaugely from my youth that I've since found. I'm noting them here just in case anybody ends up on a similar quest through search engines.

# Unsolved
* Animated film about christmas I had on VHS. A kid somehow gets taken via a old flying boat/airship to an area with rooms branching off a central room. For whatever reason, something happens and they run away back to the airship and take him home where all the family issues he had have been resolved.
* British rap duo, from either Birmingham or London, one of the two is likely bald. Not necessarily black, but also not white, unlikely late 80's, maybe early to mid 90's. Lyrics relate to living life, having a job, not necessarily stereotypical women/drug/violence themes. Music video or album cover may feature a leather chair in some kind of apartment
* Couple move to a neighbourhood and face racial tensions, because everybody thinks his wife is Jewish? The man is attacked while visiting a town hall meeting then they go on holiday to a lakeside motel.
* Crazy Art Student vandalises school by breaking windows, turns out he was a schitzophrenic and it was him all along. His art is ripped up by a teacher and then put back together with tape by his friends. named something like august underground, but not
* Cyborg sent from the future to avert a space shuttle blowing up on the launchpad from sabotage. Gets shot in the process and throws a baseball pretty far
* Father and son go on a road trip through a desert in america to find something to do with aliens. They go into a diner and are laughed at by the patrons there.
* Girl wakes up in a white bed on a space station orbiting a planet, dragged back to bed by some dude.
* kids gameshow, possibly CITV in the 90's in the UK. Towards the end, featured a challenge with 4 players escaping a tower with Metal briefcase split into 4 sections, depending on the position you finished depended on which dye packets in the briefcase went off so there was an amount of strategy involved. Not Jungle Run, Maybe Incredible Games, maybe Virtually Impossible
* Man charged with looking after womans house, has to fax a report on a specific day but accidentally shreds it so begins rewriting it, 'hijinks' ensue.
* quote - The x of latent wit shown on QI
* Ship carrying some sort of golden loot goes through wormhole, thieves either board or are already aboard ship as well. Nothing can be done when travelling FTL. Some sci-fi action and theft occurs. Similar art style to Stargate SG-1, however with submarine style door locks.
