Posts are looking a little light on the ground this year around, have a small yet low-stakes list of some of the rude roads I've seen while driving around:

* Bell End, Wollaston, Wellingborough
* Blue Ball Road, Ripponden, Sowerby Bridge
* Butt Lane, Leeds
* Fanny Hands Lane, Ludford, Market Rasen
