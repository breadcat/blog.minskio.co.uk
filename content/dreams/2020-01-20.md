I was watching a YouTube video of a vaguely Central European girl in her twenties who modified regular but oldish road cars with high tech upgrades, like replacing systems and components with other things that you'd usually find around the house.

She also drove smaller kart style racing cars called 275 cars. This was because the engines were all identical at 275cc, and installed into custom chassis on the day of the race.

I checked her wikipedia page and it said she had a history of being a bullion thief but only ever stole silver which made her crimes some how less serious.

Her online presence was tied around her surname 'Jennings' and the karts she drove '275'.
