title: Train station zombie brawl
dream: undated
---

A group of us have set off an alarm in a corner shop as we're attempting to leave it after grabbing some supplies. The family that owns the corner shop are all zombies and are milling around outside the door waiting for us to make a move.

We flee the shop and try to escape to the local train station where I find out that a few people I knew in high school <!-- JR RM --> were intentionally spreading a zombie like virus around by giving out tainted 'vaccinated blood' to people.

At the train station the group of people I know are also trying to head to the next town to spread the virus. One of the group is crying while holding an ecstasy tablet daring himself to take it before seeing us and fighting us on the train over a bridge with turnstiles on it. In the fight he ends up being flung dfrom the window onto the tracks below, dying in the process.
