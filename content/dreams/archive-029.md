I was at work during the Christmas break with all the members of staff <!-- LM AH AM --> dealing with a fault for a customer, but our offices were on a coastline instead of their usual premises.

During the call, we had our post delivered and a member of staff <!-- AH --> was going through it when everyone at once started talking about how I'd messed up.

Apparently I'd booked a disco and a party called 'The Imagination Makers' and they were charging us &pound;800 for a party that nobody had attended that I'd set up but never fully confirmed.
