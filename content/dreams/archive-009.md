I was taking place in a treasure hunt television show in the grounds of a stately home and got to ride a prototype bicycle named a 'Camerie' that used a single track instead of two separate wheels.

It worked amazingly well and I went to show the rest of the treasure hunt team as they were working on the clues themselves.

The remaining 2 members of my team were in a large movie set for an old period drama film that had run over budget so the rest of the set had been sold and used for adverts after the filming was completed.

In an earlier season of the treasure hunt show, another prototype bicycle was destroyed in a fire and only a metal frame survived.
