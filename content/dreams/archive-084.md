I was on my way to see Slipknot performing live with a couple of my friends <!-- CD TB -->. We queued up outside with our tickets for a long time before finally being let inside. The main hall was styled like a movie theatre from the 50's with heavy curtains covering the stage and big, red reclining chairs in rows to sit in.

The band came on and performed for a while before having an intermission, during this we went outside for food and drinks. In the car park were a number of 50's style cars with their boots open, selling pistols and rifles from various eras past and present.
