I was at work, walking towards the fridge to get some wraps that I plan to eat for my lunch however they're not in the fridge when I get there.

Thinking somebody from my office was playing a trick on me I asked them, but nobody was aware of where they'd gone.

I entered another office on my floor and somebody named Kim had two pieces of scrunched up cling film on her desk. She confessed to eating them but insisted that she'd done nothing wrong.

I gave her the choice to either replace them or face the consequences. The next day she didn't bring in any replacements but was eager to "face the consequences" so we got to the car park to fight and I win.
