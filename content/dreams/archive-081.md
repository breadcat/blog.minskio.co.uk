Set during the prohibition era, there was a fabled car that could reach the lofty heights of 54 mph that had been built specifically to outrun the police.

I was working with the police to stop this car and we'd set up a roadblock with large bulldozers but the driver decided to drive into them at full speed destroying the car, along with any evidence.

When the police finally tracked down the builders of this car, it was [the woman from Fargo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000531/) who very cooly played it off that the accident was caused by the accelerator being stuck and the car was otherwise perfectly normal.

After interviewing the woman, the police were all sat in a log cabin house, eating a hearty meat and vegetable stew but laughing as the carrots in it were all incredibly long.
