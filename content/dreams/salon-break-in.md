I was working at a hair dressing salon with another engineer that was being renovated shortly before reopening. We were working upstairs, running cables and the bottom floor was ready to go live.

We were leaving the left the building at the end of the day using the back door and as we walked around to the front of the building a gang of yobs were trying to break in by kicking down a section of wall without much luck.

We lingered around and they ended up getting into one section of the building by lifting up a child into the building through a broken panel and then he unlocked a door from the inside.

We went back into the building using the back door and discussed calling the police, but didn't for whatever reason, then started collecting up our tools to make a quick exit.

The owners sister who was also a hairdresser then appeared wearing hair rollers and made a sarcastic comment about the yobs trying to steal the heart of a beautiful man (referring to the owner) before we made it clear they were in the process of outright robbing the place and this was quite serious.
