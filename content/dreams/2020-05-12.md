I've been invited to my aunt's <!-- JH --> wedding but need to complete something called the long march before I could attend. It was a walk to the venue a long way north from my house.

I'm in the process of making a pasta bake before I set off but the cupboards are missing a number of supplies so I go to a local corner shop where there are Asian children running around causing havoc.

I eventually find tomato puree, and chopped tomatoes but they're scattered around the shop in multipacks that have been split up and I struggle to pay as the barcode scanner is connected to another till and the employee just shrugs at me instead of helping.
