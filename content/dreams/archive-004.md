I was doing some amateur rocketry with Kari Byron from the Mythbusters when we started to walk off in the direction of a docket we'd launched.

On our way back, we saw my next door neighbour who was asking probing questions about our TV setup. We also ran into an old school friend<!-- DoS --> who for some reason also has an interest in rocketry.

Back home, the TV licencing woman barged into a house that was laid out like another school friends<!-- CD --> and turned on the TV. I began to explain what was going on but muixed up yearly and monthly costs which she leapt on.

I couldn't explain without being interrupted so ordered her to leave where she went outside to my next door neighbours house to harass them instead.
