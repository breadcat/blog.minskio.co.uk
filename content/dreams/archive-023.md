I was sat on a bar stool at my local pub, feeling very tired. I was so tired my eyelids felt as though they were sticking together making sight almost impossible.

Somebody across the bar was throwing pool balls at my feet that dropped down from the bar stool but I couldn't do anything as my eyelids were stuck together.
