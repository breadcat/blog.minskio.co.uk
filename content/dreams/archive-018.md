I was at a friends <!-- JM RM SM --> house for a party and was looking for a bathroom. Of the three I knew existed 2 were blocked by large dogs sitting in front of the doors. The remaining one had stairs going down to it and was quite open plan.

There was a huge green tile pool in this room with huge flowing waterfalls at both ends. People were queuing for the bathroom just sat down in the water while they waited.

Eventually the pool was full of people so we went upstream where there was a man showing off an old clock that's sides burst off and little caltrops fell out bu he couldn't find all the pieces that exploded out of the clock so asked us to help him find them.
