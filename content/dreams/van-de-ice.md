I was staying at the first house I ever lived at, <!-- 159 FD --> and driving some kind of car, there was also an old beat-up sprinter van parked up on the driveway.

There was a big storm, and the car was entirely covered in about 5mm of solid clear ice. My dad said I should take the van instead and handed me a yellow spray bottle full of hot water that melted the entirety of the ice in a couple of sprays; leaving the van ready to drive.
