I was in a function room with blue tiled walls and draped fabric ceilings with my family when my sister asked if, as she was getting some food if I wanted to share an apple with her. I scoffed a little as I could easily finish an apple by myself but agreed nevertheless.

She then returned with two halves of an apple about the size of a watermelon and began to eat around the cut rim so I did the same.
