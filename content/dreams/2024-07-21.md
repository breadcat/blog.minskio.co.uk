I was at a holiday park type complex in the lake district with my girlfriend, friend and his girlfriend. <!-- CP JH KS --> We'd been to a music gig featuring a German band to celebrate some kind of political event and we'd danced and later made love.

Later on I was trying to find our room however the building was laid out strangely and I'd already entered one room where I'd entered and needed to apologise to a confused looking woman.

While wandering around I ended up seeing a large group of people with bulldogs who were encouraging them to shit on a golf course. It got later and later and I still couldn't find anybody and I couldn't ring anybody as my phone was in our hotel room.
