I was with my grandad and mum in an old 80's style office building that was being used as a care home with beige walls, ceiling tiles and flourescant lighting. For some reason we were carrying my grandad towards the lobby, with each of us lifting him under his shoulder with ours.

When we finally arrived at the lobby there was a group of people already there. There was a nurse near the main door who was instructing us all to stand in a row, before she cried out "A-N-C!" "A-N-C!".

The group of people in the lobby sat down on the carpet tiled floor and a coach arrived that we all boarded. As we drove, the weather started to deteroirate and out of the left side of the coach we saw four boys playing on two sets of see-saws.

There was an explosion and one of the boys disappeared into thin air and another transformed into a 10ft high bear type creature like something from Attack on Titan. He was ready to stomp on one of the other kids but was calling out some kind of gladiatorial thumbs up/thumbs down type of request towards our coach.
