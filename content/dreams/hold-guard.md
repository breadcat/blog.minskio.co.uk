I was in a police holding cell type place with large sandstone walls. Under the main reception desk there was a floor safe that I was aware that I could access. Inside this floor safe was 181 [Runite ore](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Runite_ore) in a plastic bag.

I ended up returning to the building after being released where I was given a mouth guard and seated at a plastic table with a table cloth with a guy sat opposite me while we tried to eat an unecessarily complicated meal based on items that had been left behind at the prison and needed eating up.

The waiter serving us was [Ross Hornby from Hat Films](https://yogscast.fandom.com/wiki/Ross_Hornby) who was also wearing a mouth guard but we all ended up laughed about how ridiculous they were to eat a meal and it turned out they were from lost and found as well.
