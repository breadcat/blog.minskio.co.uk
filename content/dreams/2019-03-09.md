I met up with an old friend from high school who said he was working with electronics and rocketry nowadays and asked if he were to work on hardware if I'd work on the software as a favour to him. I agreed and later went around to his house.

While there he had quite a professional lab setup and was soldering ball grid arrays on processors using a professional guide. He'd attached a small plastic bag over his nose to prevent himself from breathing onto the project and disturbing what he was working on.

I eventually found out that the rocket we were working on cost &pound;100,000 and was supposed to eventually get into orbit and he'd spoken to me because he didn't know the difference between ARM and x86 architectures.
