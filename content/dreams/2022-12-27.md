I was on a docked wooden pirate ship that was utterly deserted. For some reason we were trapped aboard and were looking for a way out when we found a remote controlled bomb that could walk around but couldn't jump.

I'm not sure why we couldn't just leave but the solution ended up with the group of us being sat in a lifeboat using an RC car controller to remotely direct this walkable bomb to a weak point on the ship that would ensure it sank while we escaped in the lifeboat.
