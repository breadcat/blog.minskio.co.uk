I was the passenger in a car being driven during a 'mid-night out' type of scene and we'd already seen a couple of car crashes caused by people driving at excess speed.

While driving back we saw a stumbling guy so decided to try to push him over but couldn't manage it. I decided to walk with the guy as he looked like a friend I knew from High School <!-- RoK --> but wasn't. He recognised me however so we walked together as we were both going the same way.

As we walked along a long and wide road there was an old Corsa buried in one of the side walls and the guy I was walking with turned to me, said it was "his stop" and faded away into thin air.
