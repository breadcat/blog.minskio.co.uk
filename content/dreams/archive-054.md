I was in a hotel room in the Burj Khalifa. The lifts weren't working so I was racing to the top to try to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash">green flash at sunset</a>, I got there in time and saw it.

A girl stood next to me also watching and asked me to follow her through a locker mounted to the wall which had a false back and opened with a key. Connected to the locker was a service shaft that connected to a large hidden room.
