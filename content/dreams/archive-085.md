Me and some of my friends <!-- JH RH --> were playing [Defcon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520/DEFCON/). One of my friends <!-- JH --> had allied with me as Eurasia and the other was playing as North America.

The game played differently from the actual game where in one move you had to attack, the other player defend, then the next turn you must successfully defend.

We sent over a single rocket to New York city and as it approached the target it split like a [MIRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle) hitting many targets all along the east coast.
