title: Digging on an island
dream: undated

I'm staying a a sandy floored cave excavated from a cliffside on a smallish island, hiding from packs of large blue lizards.

We have a boat moored up at the bottom of the cliff which we use to visit other surrounding islands. On one islands beach we land on, we try digging in the soft sand and find "artefacts" like TV remote controls and pieces of guttering.

As we continue digging, we find a large plane propeller attached to it's still functional engine.
