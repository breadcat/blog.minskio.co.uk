I was laid down in the back garden in the bright sun, enjoying the peacefulness of the day.

The sky then rapidly started clouding over and the wind began to whip up and howl. I was being physically pushed by this strong gale, in a circular motion with a 20 meter diameter. I collided with the hedge surrounding the gargen, then with the garage as I continued being buffeted and dragged around by the wind.

I tried pushing up from the floor but struggled. I applied more and more force, straining to push up from the floor and eventually lifted my entire body a few centimetres from the floor when I instantly woke up.
