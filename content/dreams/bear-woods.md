I was at a wooded camp site in Norway where most of the people there had pet bears that acted for the most part like dogs.

I was there walking along a tree lined path with my girlfriend. There were a large number of (evidently unused) shovels stuck in the ground, as there were also a large number of heaps of bear shit on the path.

As we looked through the tree line, we saw into various tent and caravan areas where families were happily playing games like fetch and walking their brown and black bears on leads.
