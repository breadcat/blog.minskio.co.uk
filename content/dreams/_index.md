A personal archive of dreams past and present. I originally wrote these up in a paper notebook, undated but starting in 2019 I've started dating and adding them here.

I don't pay too much attention to the content of dreams, and don't believe they hold any secret meanings. They're archived here because I find them interesting to read through later, remembering what I've forgotten.

Obviously personal details have been censored where applicable.
