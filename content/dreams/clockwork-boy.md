I'd been roped into helping a punk rock gang cover up a double murder in Whitby on the abbey hillside, there was a body in a layby and another on top of the hill in the abbey grounds.

While all of this was going on I was trying to inform the police while not drawing attention to what I was doing.

Eventually the police arrived and there was a final showdown in an old fashioned pub down an alleyway in Whitby town that was full of these stereotypical 80's punk rock gang members.

The leader of the gang had instructed his underlings to stay and fight. While the police were trying to storm the building I was bowling cricket balls through the windows from the street outside with a wide windmilling arm stroke.

One of the rules of this engagement was that you had to avoid being hit by these cricket balls, as otherwise you were out of the gang. Eventually we were down to the last gang member who I hit with a ball before he yelled out in frustration.

After he was out, he fell to a couch that happened to be part of the roller coaster track in a house-of-horrors style ride.

As the ride progressed around the building circular saws, hooks, blades and claws were removing his limbs and skin as he went past them until he reached the end of the ride where he was just a small red kidney bean type shape of a torso still sat on the couch.

Then a mechanical arm came down from the ceiling and screwed a large metal wind up key into his back while an orchestral /tada/ fanfare played before wind up music box music started playing.
