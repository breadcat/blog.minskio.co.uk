I  was in a world where traditional farming and agriculture wasn't sustainable any more, so scientists from the OECD had invented a machine where pretty much anything that contained calories could be fed into a machine then it would extract the raw materials needed, and then produce foodstuffs based on recipes contained in that machine.

The machines were huge so you'd only get one per town, so you were pretty much forced to either use the machines, struggle to grow your own food or just go without.
