I was at a friends house, sat in a filled bath in a gloomy bathroom which had cream walls and white tiles but no windows to let in natural light.

He knocked on the door and said he needed to come in to take a leak, I laughed this off and told him he'd have to wait and continued bathing.

Due to the orientation of the bath in front of the bathroom door, and the style of frosted glass door, he was able to slide one of the panes of glass out of the door and start pinching my legs and arms while I was sat in the bath.

I angrily asked him to quit it, and to use another bathroom but the pinches were getting harder to the point when I could feel pain. I then suddenly woke up with fading pain in my extremities.
