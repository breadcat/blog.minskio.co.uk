I was at my parents house in my old bedroom with my mum however all the furniture had been rmeoved and the room had been lined with poorly painted blue sheets of plywood on all the walls and floor.

I was talking with my mum who said she was having a problem with insects in the room, so gave me a barely inflated football and asked me to bounce it around, crushing the bugs in the process.
