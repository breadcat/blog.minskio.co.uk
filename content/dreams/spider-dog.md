I'd driven to a stone built terrace house to pick up my girlfriend to go out for a meal at Miller and Carter.

As I waited for her, a black pupil from a nearby school had opened my cars boot and was trying to steal a spare router that I kept in there.

At the restaurant we were seated in a conservatory with the dogs but there was no table. She mentioned this then wandered off to try and find one we could use.

As I stroked one of the dogs <!-- Moss --> I noticed there were spiders, webs and flies in her fur that seemed to be getting worse as time went by.

The insects crawled on my hands, up my arms, biting me and making my arms go numb. I tried getting up to leave the room but nobody else seemed to notice the insects.
