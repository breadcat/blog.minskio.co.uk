I was dropping a woman named Anita off at a park near my house.

She wanted dropping off at the end of a path that was just wide enough to drive down but as I drove along the path the air started getting misty and the paths sides were getting steeper and steeper.

At one point I missed the path and accidentally started to roll the car down the side of the path which was now as steep as a hill.

As we rolled down the hill I began to feel very queasy and could feel vomit rising in my throat so willed myself awake. The queasiness subsided immediately once awake.
