I was at work eating smoked mackerel and everybody in my office was complaining about the smell of it.

A couple of people in a nearby other office were also eating it and having issues with the bones.

I had hundreds of bones that I would pull out while I chewed the fish which I threw in the bin by the handful. In the bin, the bones began to knot together.

In the narrow central corridor between offices, there were about 30 people having a meeting, lining the sides with office chairs. To get to the kitchen you had to walk down the middle of the impromptu meeting room.
