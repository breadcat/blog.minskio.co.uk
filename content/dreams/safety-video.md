I was working behind the scenes filming an instructional safety video about warehouses filming a long haired lanky actor in an office environment. It had segments like keep track of false roof tiles so they don't fall on you, tripping up over cables and stock falling from shelving racks.

For some reason the main actor was really aggressive towards staff and was actively trying to hurt us by precariously leaving things where we'd either trip up, or they'd fall on us. Eventually he started chasing us with a [pneumatic nail gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_gun#/media/File:Using_a_nail_gun.jpg) firing nails around us insisting that we weren't following the rules.
