We had some new starters ar work, everything was set up for them ready to start working but they were having technical issues in the 'IT Suite' where my bosses offices were located.

I was dealing with the issues one by one when I remembered I'd left 3 [Stanley Knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_knife#Contemporary_utility_knives) blades in the room. A quiet girl had one in her hands and wouldn't return it to me. We eventually started wrestling as I tried to get the blade but I sliced up my hands, legs and stomach in the process.

After this I collected up the remaining blades, put them in my pocket and left the room as the new employees started jeering that I'd stopped the entertaining fight.

I passed my office manager <!-- LM --> on the way back to the office kitchen who saw me, then said "What happened?" before looking at my wounds and saying in a serious tone "Get help".
