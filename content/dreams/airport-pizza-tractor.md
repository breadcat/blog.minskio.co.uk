title: Airport pizza tractor

I was in an American airport with my friends girlfriend <!-- SC --> waiting for a flight back to the UK. For some reason, my girlfriend was on a later flight but I still had her passport and ticket so we dropped them off at a reception desk.

We were both quite hungry so we went on the lookout for somewhere to sit down and eat while we waited for the flight. While looking, we went through airport security and afterwards it was like a theme park and there were rolling tractor style steam powered pizza ovens driving around.

We eventually went to a sushi place where one of my old friends from high school <!-- CH --> was tere and we shared a platter of food while the female chef on the tractor argued with her son who was helping in the restaurant. At one point during the argument she managed to fling some raw beef onto my school friends' phone with her gesturing.
