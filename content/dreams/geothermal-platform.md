I was off the coast of Exeter at an abandoned oil platform in the sea. The weather there wasn't bad and you could access the platform quite easily just walking from the coast then jumping over low lying rocks in the sea.

The easily accessible part was just a flat platform that was now being used as an ice skating rink however there were more floors below that were harder to access.

The next one required jumping down onto old oil tanks, and was another skating rink that was a metre deep and filled with crystal clear frozen water.

The weather outside was getting worse however the water inside the platform was being heated by some kind of geothermal activity and hot oil was bubbling through the water and occasionally large bubbles of lava popped and warmed up the cavern.

As the storm worsened we decided to leave as to not get trapped, part of this involved jumping into a warm water pool.

A guy I was there with told me a story about a woman who had been killed in a freak storm when her own pram hit her during high winds.
