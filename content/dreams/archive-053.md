title: Dilapidated basement

I was at one of my friends house, in his basement for whatever reason. There was a brick staircase that had collapsed over time there too.

There was a white UPVC door with a glass window in it that lead outside where there were stacks of roof files that had fallen off and a postage box from a religious group that had cookies inside that were dated best before 2006.

I was copying files around hard drives in this basement and setting up a PS2 to boot game backups from a network location.
