I was working on an enormous Victorian era factory that took huge red hot iron piston shapes called dockets via two full-size trains and then processed them before sending then off to another stage to be worked on. I was there with a load of other engineers to diagnose a timing issue that either made trains return empty or some kind of molten metal pile up in the heart of the factory.

We were running through some tests and noticed the second train setting off too early, I ran alongside the train as it set off to see how quickly it accelerated for some reason. As I ran back to the group, the first train came barreling down the platform and we had to jump down onto the tracks and cower to avoid it as it overturned and derailed over the platform.
