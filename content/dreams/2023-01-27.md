I was with Tom Scott after he'd filmed a video about a disabled Latino archer showing how well he could shoot and otherwise was physically. He was unintentionally rude regarding the archers other capabilities so the archer fired a few shots into a target dummy while Tom stood quite close.

Another test was a prosthetic human hand mounted about 3 metres off the ground that you were just supposed to do a standing jump towards. Tom had a go at this and failed miserably. I tried as well and also failed but I bet that I could grab the hand by running at the wall and rebounding off of it. Nobody else believed I could but I managed it on my first try.

After grabbing the hand, the process of getting back down to the ground was to slide down brightly coloured plastic piping like a spiral staircase handrail.
