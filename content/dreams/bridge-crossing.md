I was trying to cross a bridge with a friend that only had 2 road traffic lanes and a narrow train track, no footpath in sight.

There was also a stone wall you could awkwardly climb along however this was dangerous as the caps were concaved.

In the distance we saw two older women who were trying to cross the bridge however they were trying to enter a tiny hole that was never going to work.

My friend went over to try and help them and they eventually gave up and crossed the river directly at a shallower section instead of using the bridge. The water came up to their waists but they managed to make it across eventually.

I ended up crossing the bridge by walking along the stone wall carrying a trowel in one hand and a hammer in the other. One I got to the other side, I tapped out the tune to *where is my mind* on a wooden box of pulleys that the trains would use.
