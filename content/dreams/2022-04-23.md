Due to a diversity hiring program, Paris Hilton was working as a security guard in a large storage warehouse.
To keep from being bored during the night, she'd started painting the walls from a cream colour to a dark green however was painting them in bands, one brick band at a time so had only done the first 3 bands of breeze blocks over the past couple of months.

Most evenings, the warehouse complex was broken into by four teenagers, (two male and two female, who also had two micro-pigs as pets) who had been told that one of the storage lockers in the complex contained something secret however hadn't been told the specific locker, only that they'd know it when they saw it.

As Paris was so focused on painting the walls the burgulars were never stopped or challenged and had already gone through a large percentage of the lockers but still hasn't found what they were looking for.
