I was on a road trip in a camper van on the Isle of Wight, waiting out a bad storm at a run down pub for a ferry that would arrive at 10:42.

I'd just bought a Lidl smart watch that was very feature full however you needed to remove the back plate of the watch and interact with large plastic gears to really do anything useful.

It was quite large, made of a silver metal and the watch face looked a little like [GoldenEye](https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=isch&q=goldeneye+watch).

In the pub a friend of mine <!-- AJ --> was talking with some Goths who weren't particularly happy to be bothered by him.

A few more of my friends <!-- JD and CD --> were at a table trying to perfect the '[tornado twirl](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/k-HL5k-E7qo)' trick using bottled beer. Most couldn't do it but I decided to practice with a Malteser which received plenty of support from other people in the pub.
