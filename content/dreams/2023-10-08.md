I was staying at a large stately home in the countryside with a number of outbuildings surrounding it that had been converted into holiday cottages with different families and guests in each.

The holiday cottages were made of white stone and had more than the usual amount of windows you'd expect on them. Between these cottages was a thick carpet of dark green grass interspersed with small hedges.

Outside there was an argument going on between the the owner of the stately home and a group of teenagers wearing shiny metallic bathing suits. Apparently this group of American tourists were underage and then the owner proceeded to make fun of one of the girls passports as she was born in Pensacola.
