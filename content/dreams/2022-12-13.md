I was with two women in a very tall mediterranean style house, we'd been out in town and for some reason had received an acrylic model of the leg of [Wilt from Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster's_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends#Characters) but wearing a roller skate on a plinth.

On the walk home, we'd ordered a takeaway then were waiting for it to arrive once we were home. One of the women was flirting with the delivery driver over the phone but then refused to collect the food once they'd arrived.
