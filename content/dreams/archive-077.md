I find myself in an empty car park attached to a hospital, I feel a little drunk and I'm having trouble thinking clearly and need to concentrate to be able to move.

A friend of mine <!-- RH --> from high school is there and he's trying to help me and is offering me sweets as an incentive to move. There are a few kids running around and other people I recognise from highschool.

I wake up as I find my car in the corner of the car park but I don't know where my keys are.
