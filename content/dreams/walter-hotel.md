I was in an abandoned and dilapidated hotel in an asian country like Thailand. The hotel was in the middle of nowhere set in a forest that bordered the sea.

There were guards who were there mainly just for show and didn't actively do much to keep you there due to the isolation of the place. There was also a female warden with long black hair that was tied in thick ornate knots hiding.

I was there with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad. Walt had a plan and even though there were opportunities to escape he'd held back until we stood better changes.

He'd fixed up a pool filtration system to purify water and the guards were impressed that the water in the pools was now running clear. He was also growing mushrooms as a foodstuff for the journey in a dank underground room.

Jesse didn't see the big picture and was always looking for short term gains. The warden also liked to play games and would pose us challenges which winning would grant us points that had no real value. One challenge was guessing the length of her hair after it was untied (28 metres), or an archery challenge that involved waiting for the right moment.
