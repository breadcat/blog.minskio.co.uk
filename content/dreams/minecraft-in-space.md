I was on a space station similar to [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Station_Silicon_Valley) where there were separate branching pods all with different biomes connected via glass tubes.

Each glass encased biome was strangely low resolution and had a [low-poly aesthetic](https://www.blendernation.com/2017/03/20/tutorial-low-poly-trees/) to it. Inside one of the biomes there was a small cabin, and inside this cabin there was an old computer on a wooden desk with a CRT display showing the time as a [bouncing screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mGuCdlCcNM). Whenever I looked away from this display the time kept chaning forwards and backwards.
