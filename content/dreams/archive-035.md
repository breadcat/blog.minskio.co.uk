title: Quad bike crash
dream: undated

I was walking home through some kind of large city when a guy on a quad bike riding around unsagfely comes off the road and falls down where men are working on the road. There are signs about raised iron works surrounding the site.

Nobody really seems to notice this so I mention it to a security guard in the building and he and another guard go to check it out. I try to go down as well but the second guard pushes me back as they radio in that they've found something else more serious.
