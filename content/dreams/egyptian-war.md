I was stationed in Egypt with about 30 or 40 soldiers during a war in the 1980's, I was driving around in a six wheeled APC type vehicle decorated in desert camouflage.

We split into two groups, one was trying to flush out an enemy whereas my group was staying around some ancient ruins hoping to ambush the same enemy force.

I entered these ruins as it was cooler down there during the day and found some kind of mysterious treasure that would win us the war.
