I was on my own in a Tesco's car park driving an old silver BMW. There were a few chavs lingering around in other cars chatting and so on so I drifted my car near them.

They all jumped in their cars and we drove around the car park doing synchronised drifts, tyres squeeling and doughnuts.

Afterwards we were talking and there was one guy who was really proud of his kit car, the building process involved assembling the shell of the car which was made out of fabric and resembled a tent including poles.
