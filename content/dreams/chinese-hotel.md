I was in a world where the majority of the population were zombies, but rarely seen.

Me and the other survivors all banded together in a large hotel which had just finished being build but had never opened in mainland China and as such the door locks had never been configured correctly.

There were bath tubs in every room and a swimming pool on most floors. We were avoiding another group of survivors that could become invisible for whatever reason.
