I was riding my bike through a park at night when I accidentally ran over a small squirrel like animal. A few walkers around me ran over to have a look at I assured them I'd get the animal some help. Downa  flight of stair there were 3 police officers and a WPC came up to examine the animal.

She looked in shock and told everyone around to lie as still as possible as big badger like animals were swarming around us, they were apparently very dangrous but would completely ignore you if you played dead. One started dragging me around by my leg so I tried waking myself up which dissolved elements around me until I was in a completely white room with music playing backwards but I could still feel myself being dragged around.
