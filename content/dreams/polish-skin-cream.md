I was on holiday in a European city in a cosy but sparesely decorated room with a double bed, white tiled walls and a patch of black mold on a high ceiling.

I was with a friend who had brought with them a group of people I didn't know who'd just happened to be there and we were all socialising in English.

In the middle of the conversation one of the women in the group had mentioned a specific skin cream so her and my friend left the house to get some, leaving me alone with the group of unknown people.

A tall blonde haired man then started speaking to me, he had a son of about 14 who looked mostly identical to him. His son was explaining that my friend was very pretty while his dad encouraged him to ask her out in a sort of joking manner.

The father who was in his mid 30's then explained he was Polish, so I tried explaining I knew only one word in Polish, *czkawka* for hiccups but I was pronouncing it wrong. I then tried explaining the *other* word I knew in Polish but he already was well aware of the prevelence of kurwa.

He then tried explaining to me about 'sniffins' which was a kind of jokey rude word for male toilets, like 'bogs' in English.

By this time my friend had arrived back with a clear glass vase shaped vessel with a screw lid with a thick creamy liquid inside that was applied with a honey dipper.
