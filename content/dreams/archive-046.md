For whatever reason I'd chosen to cut my own hair and eyebrows with a pair of hair trimmers but refused to use a mirror. I'd also bought some 'warming glow' skin cream that was good for your skin and was applied with a hair drier type device.

Later, at work I was speaking to an employee <!-- LS --> who didn't mention anything about my hair but afterwards I looked in a mirror in the bathroom to find I had shaved the inner halves of my eyebrows, had a hair style like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guile_(Street_Fighter)">Guile</a> going through chemo and was <b>incredibly darkly</b> tanned.

Nobody at work said anything about my appearance whatsoever.
