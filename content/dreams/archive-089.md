title: Defacing crucifixes

Me and some friends from school are leaving a house party in the middle of the afternoon in the local town. As we walk alongside the library we come across a huge gothic looking church with an ornately decorated crucifix outside with names engraved around it in the black marble.

We agree that it's cool looking but one of us says that he plans to steal it. He throws a small pebble at the crucifix and manages to knock out the middle of one of the letter O's.

As a group, we decide that this is a sign and we leave it well alone.
