I was in a bathroom in a red brick school when a school friend<!-- CW --> stood next to me having a piss and explained he needed his dog to go home. I agreed to help him as it was my last class of the day.

I put the Shibe dog in my car when another different school friend<!-- SG --> said she needed something or other relating to a train station and a cheap looking pair of black heeled shoes.

Me and my girlfriend drove to a very firefly-esque train station where we needed to get to the other side of the tracks to complete task number 2, as the train was coming into the station.

The train station was extremely busy, and we were unable to move the dog as it was asleep in the footwell of my car. For some unknown reason there was a full sized bike in the boot of the car.
