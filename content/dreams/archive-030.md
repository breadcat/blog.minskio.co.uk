I was at home with my family and we'd just moved in to a terraced house when our new next door neighbour came in to welcome us to the street. They had three dogs that immediately ran indoors and were playfull snapping at one another and a large otter that sat on the threshold to the house. They had a chinese son who stood back from the rest of the family and was just stroking the otter.

On the way to the house we had to pull over on a country toad to let a bike with no rider pass us, and a large white range rover.
