I was sat in a cosy bar in a futuristic Japanese city with a few friends<!-- RH HH --> who were explaining what life was like since they'd moved to this new city.

The conversation turned to how extremely exclusive meat was these days and I explained that for whatever reason, I had a small amount of meat on me and pulled a fresh beef burger wrapped in butchers paper wrapped in twine out of my coats pocket.

My friends were shocked and urged me to put it back before anybody saw, before telling me that burger would be worth a few million Yen, and they could put me in touch with a dealer who would take it off my hands for a fair price.
