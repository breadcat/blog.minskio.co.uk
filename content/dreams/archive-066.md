Me and a group of highschool friend <!-- RH TH JH --> were playing Smash Brothers at my grandparents house, one of the group had taken the car out to go shopping for breakfast cereal at the packet we'd bought was full of lavender leaves.

Everyone was commenting on how well I was going as I'd been practicing earlier against the AI.

The final part of the stage came about and you had to dunk your competitors pokemon in front of a big crab themed boss. I used the same spammy attack against all my competitors and we were all laughing about how it worked every single time.
