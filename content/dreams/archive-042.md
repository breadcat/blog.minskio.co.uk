I was dreaming about swimming at highs chool with it's various cliques.

I wasn't immediately accepted into any group but still competed and won a 25 metre front crawl race by a huge margin, even struggling to slow down as the end approached.

After getting to the other side, I ran out of the gym and jogged barefoot outside where my mother was talking a native American guy I knew.
