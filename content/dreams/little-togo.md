I was alone at my parents house in my old bedroom when I saw a little monkey like animal that could speak. It said it's name was Togo and when asked to leave it just wouldn't, offering excuses and then running away from me.

I picked it up and by the scruff of its neck and uncerimoneously threw it out of the door after carrying it downstairs. My parents then appeared and told me off for being so rough with Togo as it continued to taunt me and dance around after repeatedly being thrown out of the house but returning shortly afterwards.
