I was at a music gig with my girlfriend, a school friend and his girlfriend<!-- JH, SC -->. There were plenty of acts to see but it was our turn to see Noel Gallagher.

It was absolutely bouncing it down with rain and the gig consisted of the whole audience playing football as a single team against Noel on stage wearing a mech suit made of bamboo all while he was singing.

After the gig we went to get our stuff from lockers but we couldn't find my posessions in locker F-22 because none of the lockers were in alphabetical or even sequential order.
