I was in my old junior school, with am old friend <!-- JE --> who was guiding me round as they'd massively expanded into the school playing field with modern appartment buildings.

He had been hired to stop some violent break ins where teachers had been tied up before the classrooms were burgled of their IT equipment.

I was wearing a [purple HAM cloak](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ham_hood) which I'd found while sneaking into the school. One of the teachers saw us and came over to ask questions but I passed easily with no suspicion.
