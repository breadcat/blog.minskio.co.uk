I was in a gloomy city where there were large monsters that would invade the space from time to time.

Nobody really knew where they came from however it was understood they could be summoned by nefarious people.

These monsters were extremely dangerous and the best advide for the public was to get well out of their way.

There was however a team of people who used retro looking wrist mounted computers with CRT screens and beige keyboards that you could enter magical incantations called prompts into that would weaken the monsters in certain ways before a final incantation would defeat them at last.

It turned out that the best promoter on our team was also one of the people summoning these monsters using dark magic by sacrificing a piece of himself, thus giving him direct control over the monsters, then claiming the glory when they were defeated.

I was parking my car after just working this betreyal out when a large monster, twice as tall as me and shaped like a dark slender dog attacked.

I ran into a shop that had a delicate purple tablecloth drying inside for some reason and hid behind it as the monster stalked me before I woke up.
