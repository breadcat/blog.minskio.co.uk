I was a teacher in a classroom of about 25 kids, it was the start of the day and I'd given them all an assignment to write a script for a movie featuring people they knew. As an example, I'd started telling a story about a boy from class <!-- RC --> but predictably nobody knew him so the example didn't work.

I needed to piss quite badly so left the classroom to look for a toilet. The school was absolutely huge but mostly empty. After searching for a short time I went outside and eventually decided to piss behind a wooden shed. As I walked around this shed to find the back of it, I noticed that it had no windows or doors anywhere on it.
