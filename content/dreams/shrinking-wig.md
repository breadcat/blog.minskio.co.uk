I was in a world with about 50 or so people, the world around us was gradually shrinking and had been for a few months.

There was a family who were there with about 5 kids who were by far the largest single group and were arguing and trying to burn down some of the abandoned buildings.

Me and an older guy managed to convince them to remain together as an uneasy group.

An old woman with dark hair was crying in a bar and I comforted her before dancing with her as she cried on my shoulder as it was the last bit of normalcy in this decaying world.
She revealed she was wearing a permed wig as she was bald and a friend of mine <!-- JH --> laughed at me as I showed her pictures of when I was younger with different ridiculous hair cuts, like a blonde perm and a 2000's emo haircut while at a gig.
