I was walking through an industrial estate on a terraformed alien planet with active volcanoes, ash and smog everywhere.

I was carrying a heavy metal box that had battery terminals on it and was constantly leaking water behind me as I progressed.

As I walked past forklift trucks and factories using the volcanic power I went over a hill and saw in the distance that I'd walked about 15 kilometres with the battery.
