I was at home my parents house having just given blood, my arm was aching and I needed to go the the bathroom as well. As I walked along the landing towards the bathroom the floor seemed to slope upwards and walking further was a real struggle.

I reached my left arm out to try grab ahold of something to stop from falling backwards and saw my needle mark had started bleeding again, I gingerly pulled off the plaster which was now heavy with blood and it started oozing back out again thickly.

I tried throwing away the plaster away but it just hung in the air about 50cm from where it left my fingers. My arm was covered in blood trickles intertwining and I still couldn't make any progress towards the bathroom.
