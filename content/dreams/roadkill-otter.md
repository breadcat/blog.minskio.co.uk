I was in Australia with [Beau Miles](https://www.youtube.com/@BeauMiles) and he was showing me how to prepare different wild game, and incidentally discussing a time when he ate a dolphin.

We were walking together along a highway and he exclaimed that in the distance he could see a dead bird laying by the side of the road before discussing what to do with the potential meal.

As we walked closer to it, he mentioned that we were coming up on one of his preferred delicacy aisles, which happened to be a small fenced in yard housing an otter which he summarily killed with a thin long blade.

Just as the animal died the owner came out of the connected house and berated us for killing his pet otter, telling us there was no good meat on otters.
