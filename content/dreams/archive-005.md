I was conducting a lot of paperwork based tasks before arriving at an airport ot get a flight to an unknown destination.

There was a lot of travelling involved and 2 reams of paper bound with black tape on their spines. A number of people were commenting that it wouldn't be possible to travel from point A to B before the flight departed but I was riding a futuristic motorbike. Seeing this, the people would block my way intentionally.

When I arrived at my unknown destination I couldn't leave the airport because somebody had fucked up the paperwork before I carried it through the gates.
