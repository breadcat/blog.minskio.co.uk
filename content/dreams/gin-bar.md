I was at an old friends house preparing for a night out, and having a few pre-drinks.

The was an undercurrent of young versus old in the group with the younger members having to return home for 4am, whereas the older members were allowed to stay out until 5. This age gap sometimes just came down to a couple of months.

We arrived in town and entered an extremely fancy gin bar. The younger group rushed in and ended up ordering expensive but ultimately bland bottled beers.

Surrounding the central bar area were alcoves showing the ornate cut glasswear you'd get, and a chance to smell the ingredients that went into each drink.

The venue was quite busy so I only sampled two of these alcoves and settled on ordering a white themed *sweet almond versus prior parma violets* drink.

Just before I was about to order, one of the group who'd only gotten bottled beer intentionally pulled the fire alarm so everybody had to leave.
