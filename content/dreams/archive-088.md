I'm staying over at friends house <!-- JM -->, it's recognisable but has a different layout and looks more modern.

We agree to go and watch a stage show and while I'm sat in my chair watching the show, I feel somebody poking my side. I push the hand away and it happens again and again. After the third poking I grab the hand and bend their fingers back. A female voice gasps in pain and it turns out it was my friends younger sister <!-- BM --> who was doing the poking.

After a small amount of commotion, we all go home and for some reason the spare bed is set up in my friends sisters' room.

We have an argument about who is sleeping where which is eventually settled via the "tog of the duvet" and somebody using the phrase "It's in your DNA".
