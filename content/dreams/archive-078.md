title: Spinning platform
dream: undated

I'm on a rocky platform around the size of a double bed hovering in mid-air and there's another similar platform that I need to get to.

Around me there's a constant [ambient droning noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTMM3dsARVs) and in the sky the clouds are all yellow. The platform I'm stood on starts to spin, and I'm struggling to hold on.

I'm aware that this is a dream at this point so concentrate on waking up as I'm starting to feel nauseous. I wake up a few seconds later with a strong feeling of heartburn.
