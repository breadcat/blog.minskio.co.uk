I was working on a barn conversion with my old boss, <!-- JS--> we were turning the roof rafter space into a modern office.

He has grandiose ideas about removing a load of supports that were getting in the way and removing an entire row of stone bricks and having a wraparound window that went around the entire building. There was also a turret section in one corner that would house his desk that needed the floor lowering as well.

We'd turn up, then he'd claim to have forgotten his tools and that the plans needed amending some more, so wouldn't actually do any physical work and just expect me to do it while looking busy but ultimately not doing anything.

After removing the supports the floor would rock back and forth when you walked on it which he thought was fine but I told him was a serious problem.
