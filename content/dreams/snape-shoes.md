I was shopping for my lunch in a Morrison's supermarket with a colleague from work. There wasn't a lot of space near the entrance and I ended up bumping into someone with my trolly to which they they replied saying it was fine but called me Jessica, which my colleague found hilarious.

At the threshold of the vegetable section where the gates were was a tall female security guard who looked a lot like Alan Rickman playing Snape in Harry Potter so being a little cheeky my colleague asked for a selfie. This guard towered over them by a good 40 plus centimetres but when I asked they were about my height.

I mentioned this height disparity and they showed me a pair of custom double shoes that you could bend forwards in and the heel would extend or retract. The mechanism was smooth and silent and me and the guard were talking about how she'd made them commenting on the quality of the steel used.
