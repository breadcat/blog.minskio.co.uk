I was in a hall with other people milling around before some kind of a party started. I didn't know at the time however it ended up being a funeral for an old lady I didn't know either. This detail was only revealed when a large white cloth covering her portrait was ceremonially dropped. I was then given a heavy piece of green painted metal and a scraggy looking pillow with an embroidered cat on it for no real reason.

I left the hall where it was dark outside and walked onto a street. I saw a few friends of mine from high school where one <!-- BA --> had lit a cigarillo, was dressed in a trendy way but acting aloof. I spoke with a few other people I knew but only very briefly.

Then another one of my friends from high school <!-- JS --> was sat down cross legged on a flat roof by the side of the road and started throwing down old balls that had become stuck on the roof much to the delight of the crowd in the road.

After this he started throwing pieces of metal into the crowd but seemed to be aiming for me specifically all while a Marilyn Manson-esque song played that had "don't become a welder" as the chorus before he used one of the pieces of the metal as a blowpipe and started shooting white paintballs at me with it.
