I was in a research lab in a futuristic Japanese city that took up the entire floor space and was maybe 3 storeys high. I was part of this research as I'd been injured years before and instead of being drafted for frontline combat I was tasked with human experimentation instead.

Inside this space, the ground was covered in grass and there were cliffs on the walls, but we were still indoors. Aesthetically the room was like a mashup of [Oblivion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/), [Annhilation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/) and [Super Mario Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy).

On the ground, arranged in a star shape were maybe 10 white bone shaped pods that had clear plastic screens covering seats where two people could sit at either end of. In the middle of these two seats was a metal hatch that you loaded circular white tablets into and closed them like an [M1 Garand rifle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GdTKm4eBAs). The pods were all labelled with names starting with S, my pod was called Soju and the one next to me was called Sake. Once loaded and activated these tablets would influence the people and the pods, and the outcomes would vary whether the experiment was observed or not. The phrase used for these unobserved transformations was 'blind life' and the white capsules were called 'life tablets'.

During other experiments some people went crazy and the pod next to mine was activated and the person inside turned into a horific dog monster.

In my experiment, I was one of the last people left alive and my opposite pod was left intentionally empty. I emerged totally unaffected by the life tablet, but the opposite side had become entirely filled with wild grass and flowers when opened.
