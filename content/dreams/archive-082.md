I was at home and heard a commotion outside in the back garden and saw a white transit van being forced to drive through the bordering stone wall being chased by police who were yelling at the driver to stop.

They eventually made it through the wall and continued driving in a diagonal line through the garden until they reached the hedge which my car was parked behind. They just continued driving, ramming my car out of the way.

After driving through the garden, they pulled onto the main road towards the local town. <!-- BH -->

My parents returned home and my mother was amazed at the extent of the damage and was questioning whether her animals were all okay, which they were. My father in comparison seemed fairly chilled about the whole affair.
