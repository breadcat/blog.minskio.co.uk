I was tasked with terraforming and replacing an alien race on a planet that looked like the Badlands national park in the US, the alien race had barely been established but had made small settlements like frontier towns.

I was using a gun type device that shot nano particles like a combination of [The Clentaminator](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Clentaminator) and Nanolathes from Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander. Once used, it would replace their small houses with city style tower blocks.

The replacement race were being helped to establish this planet as they were allied with us humans and would guard a wormhole near the planet for us.

I was in the process of deciding where the roads and city limits should be, and where the city should stop to preserve the stunning views of the desert cliffs and stone work.
