I was playing some kind of violent hide and seek game with groups of letting in tactical outfits in an old bandoned and dilapidated brick house.

I was finding and the opposing team had all hidden under piles of leaves in a room. They all burst out at once with dogs in tow overwhelming me but one stayed behind to try to sneak and kill me.

We ended up grappling in the leaves until I had my hands around his neck and was about to choke him out but he punched me in the chest, winding me.

I pulled back my fist ready to punch him in the head but didn't, upset that I immediately went to that option.
