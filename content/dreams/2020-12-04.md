I was driving through a desert that looked like [Monument Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley), only in Utah in a convoy of about 10 RV's, we were talking via walkie talkies about the colour of the stand and stone and how great the weather was. We had a schedule to keep, and get to a camp before stopping for the night.

I was driving with a girl I didn't know called Rachel who said we should push on to the next camp as we were making good time. It started getting dark while driving and traffic on the road was getting worse and worse until we were eventually at a standstill as it started raining heavily.

We had no food or drink and were getting cold and we considered pulling off to the side of the road to camp for the night but we kept on pressing on.
