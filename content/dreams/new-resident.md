We were driving past a house that a friend of mine <!-- JM --> used to live in but in retrospect I didn't recognise. I was driving two women when I decided to take a shortcut that I thought I knew before becoming stuck in the garden.

We met the houses new owner and they helped us carry the car back to the main road. We decided to go back one day in the future and as I parked up alone this time to meet my friend and the houses new owner I heard a man crying in an adjacent field.
