I was installing a phone system at a metal working shop and was working near heavy still-operating machinery while the machine was still on. As I reached into a machine it started to move and then stop abruptly as it detected my arm inside the machine.

A worker came to me and said he thought it would have been me causing the problem. He wanted to take me to go to the reception office and offered me a lift on the machine that had stopped working.

We drove down a long tree lined and barrier lined  road. At one point I jumped off as he seemed distracted and accidentally swerved near the side rail barriers nearly crushing my legs. I jumped back aboard after this and continued to ride.

Further down this road we were attacked by two small bears which I initially thought were dogs. I beat them away using a small plastic bag of cable ties.

We eventually joined a main road and the scenery was looking quite nice so I pulled out an old mobile phone and tried taking a picture but the camera preview showed the world filled with a kind of dark static.
