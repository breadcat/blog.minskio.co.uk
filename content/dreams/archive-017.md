I was in high school doing my GCSE course in Spanish but nobody was taking it seriously and different people were calling out correct answers at the same time.

To combat this we started to use these styluses that could somehow know when you were cheating but you had to physically tap things to get the words to appear.

All the questions were food centric, for example, one question was about a chicken and mushroom dish so I had a ready meal plate on my small desk fishing around with the stylus for mushrooms

We could still cheat the test by swapping ready meals plates
