I was walking through rural Sweden, talking with an old man about his life. I was wearing a beanie, a big old coat and old heavy boots.

We'd started off at a large lake that had been bridged by a spit of land that was around 5cm submerged in the water so you were wading through it, splashing the water around as you walked.

After the lake, we continued walking to a valley floor that was covered in a thick carpet of green. On the cliff sides surrounding us there were a number of modern A-frame houses built straight into the cliff faces.

It was raining slightly and the air was thick with fog,  There were a few trees, but the majority of the greenery was just thick grass and moss as far as the eye could see.
