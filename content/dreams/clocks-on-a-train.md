title: Clocks on a train

I was on a train with my boss from work <!-- JB -->, it was very old fashioned and I was unsure of where we were actually going.

There were a lot of clocks in the carriage and suddenly one started to ring like a bedside alarm clock. We were looking around the carriage for around five minutes to find which one of the clocks had gone off.

My boss eventually went over to a large silver bowl of sand on the table next to us and starts digging with his hands. Inside this bowl of sand there's a tiny battery that's making the alarm noise.

The noise is actually my alarm clock that's been sounding for about ten minutes in real life.
