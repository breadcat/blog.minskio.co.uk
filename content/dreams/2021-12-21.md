I was asked to repair a complicated looking audio devices by a coworker, it was quite a bulky object around the size of a lunch box and inside there were multiple smaller circuit boards around the size of a credit card with a number of cables, connectors, heatsinks and other components.

Four some reason the only reference material I had access to was an animated TV show in the style of paw patrol where the main character, a child who looked like [Caillou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caillou) walked you through the complete and functional device explaining what components did what and where everything went.
