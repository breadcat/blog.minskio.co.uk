I was a young kid of around 10 years old playing with an older group of kids who I didn't really know that well. The older group would break rules for fun, encouraging me to do the same which I would eventually and hesitantly do.

We were at a childrens playground with a large metal space ship on it. There was a huge rush to get to this ship and input the flight programme before it took off.

An old man was sat cross legged using an impact driver to repair a section of fence in another area of the park that had presumably been damaged by children.

The group I was with vaulted the railings to get to the ship as quickly as possible while the old man shouted at them and I walked around using the gate.

While everyone else was panicking around the ship I calmly sat in the bottom where the engine nozzles were located.

Everyone turned to me and asked for the flight programme and I calmly opened my wallet and produced a small scrap of paper which was aparently good enough to do the job.
