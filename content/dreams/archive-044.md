My sister had decided to buy a new car but was nervous as to what to speak to the garage about so went with my father. I went along for the ride but was dropped off at a house in Elland for whatever reason.

Inside, I was cooking a large number of &pound;1 coins in a rotary oven while comparing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bateman">Bateman</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Trump</a>.

My two cousins <!-- PH MH --> came around with a younger sister who I'd never seen before who had the same hair colour as them who had a plastic replica sword from a video game. The sword was bent and damaged and we were jokingly appraising it like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiques_Roadshow">Antiques Roadshow</a>. After the appraisal the conversation turned to how staplers work.
