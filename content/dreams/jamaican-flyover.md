I was waiting for a bus at a roofed bus stop in a city when I heard a fly by of jet aircraft.

I'd only recently seen the red arrows in real life flying by, so looked upwards gazing around not seeing anything.

After about ten seconds however a formation of red arrows escorting a large black fighter jet flew by while people around me gasped and pointed.

I was about to ask my girlfriend to check what the large black aircraft was when a Jamaican guy who was also waiting for the bus exclaimed in admiration "look at that 1820 Raddo-raster" while pointing.

I then noticed his young son, sat cross legged on the ground playing with models of planes (including the large black one) scattered around the floor before saying with more urgency "look out, don't step on me 1820 Raddo-raster!" to pedestrials milling around the street.
