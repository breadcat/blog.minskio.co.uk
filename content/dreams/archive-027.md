I was at a university in Canada called 'Delvin University' or something similar. We were told very little and I never actually got into any actual classes.

There was a lot of conflicting information about timetables and scheduling and we seemed to have to work things out for ourselves almost like a test of sorts as the teachers spun the story but in reality things were just very poorly planned. Some students had already been there for weeks and still didn't have a timetable that made sense.

There was a large notice board in the middle of the yard but it was just a chalk board with faint and incomplete writing.

There was also an app you could download, but nobody could find it on their phones and just one person was rumoured to have it installed.
