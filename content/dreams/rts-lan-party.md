I was at a friend and his girlfriend's house but it was more of a summer house then their usual apartment.

We had a number of computers set up on the top floor and were playing Red Alert 1 but the rules about ocean based combat were entirely different and totally useless.
The map was almost entirely water based with a thin layer of rock encircling it which made base building difficult and movement even harder still.

We reached some kind of stalemate so went off to make sandwiches, but their fridge was full of nothing but condiments in large plastic containers that were mostly empty.
