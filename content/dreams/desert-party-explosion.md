title: Desert party explosion
dream: undated

I'm attending a surprise birthday party in the desert at somebody's house. We're all wearing colourful masks but the birthday girl doesn't know it's a surprise party and believes we're all maliciously messing with her. Eventually the party gets going.

As the party begins to die down I go to the garage connected to the house to repair a tyre where I can hear a gas leak. One of the drunken party guests runs towards me carrying a candle and I yell out for him to stop and attempt to run away but there's a huge explosion behind me due to the gas buildup.

The only survivors of the explosion are me and the flaming candle guy where we begin to brawl in the dusty desert for him not listening to me and causing the deaths of everyone else in the house.
