title: Letters to you
dream: undated

It was dark and I was walking home alone over small broken shards of stone near a flood management setup. I heard voices behind me and looked back to see a group of people about 150 metres away.

I looked down at the floor and saw clothes that I owned and brown paper letters addressed to me. Knowing this was a dream I tried to become lucid but instead woke myself up.

When I woke up I was at my friends house <!-- JM --> with my family. I went over to my father and grabbed his shoulder but when he started talking to me it was gibberish nonsense.

Knowing I was still dreaming I forced myself awake.
