title: Farmers foxes

I was walking to school through a wooded valley with my whole family. I'm wearing steel toe capped boots and suddenly a fox starts running towards me. I pull back my foot and kick the fox as hard as I can, where it goes flying in an arc, landing some distance from us.

A dog we have with us for some reason bolts after the fox and chases it onto a farmers land before attacking it, making lots of noise.

The farmer whose land we're on comes out of his house brandishing a shotgun and tells us that he's had enough of us trespassing, mistaking us for another group of people. My father produces and automatic rifle and the two have a standoff.

In the standoff I'm shot in the face and get my eye replaced with a bright blue prosthetic.
