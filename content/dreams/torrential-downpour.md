I was travelling with my girlfriend in the car through what looked to be a small English village.

It was raining really heavily and it seemed like pretty much every road we went down was either flooded or blocked with cars stuck in floods waters.

Sometimes we would be driving down a single track road, come across a passing point but other cars would refuse to use these or would be outright stuck entirely blocking the road.

Eventually we parked up on a grassy verge near a pub called *The Captains Quarters*, leaving the car and trying to get to the pub but again soon became trapped by flood waters.
