All our immediate family were at my grandfathers house which was a multi-floored 'Louisiana Plantation Owner' style type of deal.

Everyone was laughing and joking at my expense detailing my joke phone, and that I'd brought bags of golden sultanas as a gift to my grandfather. To escape this, I'd brought a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick">Philip K Dick</a> short stories to read upstairs away from everyone else.

A sandwich delivery boy came to the house and rang the doorbell and I had to let him in. The sandwich was for my father and after he'd taken it my grandfather told me I had to eat the unwanted bag of golden sultanas.
