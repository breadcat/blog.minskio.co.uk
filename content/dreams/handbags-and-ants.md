title: Handbags and ants

I was driving to work with my mothers handbag sat on the passenger seat with the windows open. The handbag flies out through the window as if picked up by a gust of wind.

I pull over and try to reach the bag but by the time I get there it's already been run over by a number of vehicles, has been dragged down the road and is overall quite damaged.

I start to run after the bag but get hit by a car travelling at high speed. I spin through the air and land roughly by the side of the road. When I come to, I'm lying on the ground and have centipedes and ants crawling all over my splayed arms.
