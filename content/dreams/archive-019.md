title: Cubed car

I had an old car <!-- Silver Corsa --> that needed disposing of so my father told me to take it to the scrap yard to get it turned into a cube. We got the car started  and I drove it down while my father drove my newer replacement car <!-- White Corsa -->.

When we got there I moved the cars around so the older car was closest to a robotic crane but it picked up my newer car instead and crushed it into a cube before I could stop it.

My first thought was that my keys, wallet and phone were still in there so I'd have to go about re-ordering credit cards, getting keys cut and buying a new phone.
