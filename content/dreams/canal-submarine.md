I was dreaming about a guy called Chris Harlet who had built a single man sized submarine type vessel that could be rowed entirely by yourself by waggling your legs and clenching handles in your hands.

He'd set a human powered canal speed record in this and was looking to take the technology further to improve the speeds. There was a video documenting this that showed a large wake and him passing a barge on the canal at high speed.

Chris also has a kayak type vessel that could be rowed using a board as large as a surfboard as a paddle.
