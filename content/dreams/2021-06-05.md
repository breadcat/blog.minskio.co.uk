I was living in a tiny house with modern Scandinavian designed rooms. My neighbour an older woman, was explaining that she'd just had a man and a woman come round, criticise her houses design and steal possessions while they were going round the rooms.

I heard a knock at the door and saw a goth looking couple asking if they could come in. I knew they were the thieves but I let them in anyway as I wanted to refute their criticisms of my house.

We went to the bedroom that was only really large enough for a double bed and a couple of wardrobes built into the side wall. There was a hatch in the ceiling you could use to enter rooms above. The male goth was rooting through the wardrobe criticising my style of clothing while the goth woman was clambering up the ladder to the room above criticising the level of dust around the ceiling. I passed her a fluffy duster on a stick and said if it bothered her she was more than welcome to have a quick dust while checking out the house but she dismissed this with a drawling "Dear" and a look.

This impromptu inspection went on for about half an hour with them not liking anything they saw really before they both decided to leave and I had to wander around the house taking stock of what they might have stolen.
