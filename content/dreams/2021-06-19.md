I was playing a game with boss battles on it on a new console that looked like a PlayStation 5 but the side panels were coloured in midnight blue and gold.

The gist of the boss battle was that you had to take damage personally for the boss to be damaged and you healing yourself would heal the boss too.

The boss was enormous and visually looked like Vishnu and she would hunt you like an angry human trying to catch a mouse.

There were different stages to the battle and after a certain amount of damage had been taken by both parties new stages of the fight would unlock.
