In 1930-1940's Britain a program slowed down peoples' lives. One man drank a pint of milk for breakfast before going to work in a large industrial factory whereas his wife had tea and cereal.

His wife made freddo bars and delivered them on a bicycle while the man marched into the factory with the other workers.
