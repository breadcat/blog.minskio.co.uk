Jeremy was a stegosaurus living in an otherwise perfectly functional stegosaurus community and a dinosaur themed world. He was fairly meek and ineffective and would compete with his neighbours over trivial things that had no bearing on life at large. Such as woodworking DIY projects in his front garden, frantically sawing through wood with the first and shavings flying up around him.

His actual job and real passion however was space as this world was locked in bloody competition with a faceless enemy on another world. For some reason, at one point Jeremy was flying his fighter ship (just stood near a window, like a bored house cat, no seats or cockpits involved) alone in the cosmos when he was ambushed by the faceless foe.

He tried retreating but wouldn't have made it back to the safety of his home planets orbit so he took a chance and flew to the home world of the calclons, a mysterious cybernetic race that nobody had seen or heard anything from for hundreds of years. As he approached a single enormous ship came up to meet him and the faceless foes backed off.
