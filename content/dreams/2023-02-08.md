I was cycling high up in the Austrian Alps when I stopped off at a British style pub where I was served some sticky dates in a bag with a pint of cold beer.

As I sat down at my table I was being harassed by a dog, my friend <!-- CD --> produced a board game from a stack of them near the bar and we started to play, but the barman took up a microphone and started a quiz to the nearly empty pub.
