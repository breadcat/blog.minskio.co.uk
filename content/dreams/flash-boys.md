I was staying at some kind of halfway house where [Tom Felton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Felton) was working as a guidance councillor and makeshift guard.

In some of the rooms' false ceilings were flimsy wooden tripods with metal trinkets dangling from the middle of them. If you knew how, you could use these tripods to time travel however every time this happened you'd lose all memory of being able to time travel. Whenever this time travel happened it was known in the house as a Flash Event and was generally spoken about in hushed whisper and shrouded in mystery.

One other person in the house had recently *flashed away* however the guards there had said that it was a suicide, however there were certain telltale clues like receipts left around the house showing things being purchased at the exact moment the person had flashed away for products that didn't make sense.
