title: Martian tropes

Me and my girlfriend were on a dusty red planet like mars, waiting for a space ship to pick us up, while a traditional train track ran around the rim of the crater we were in.

We were joking about how many awful horror tropes were in play, as a scout ship came down near a metal tower we said that an alien would board the ship and it did, so we waved it off and said see you later.

We decided to go through the train instead but every fifth passenger was a big guy like [Edgar from men in black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/characters/nm0000352), you could just walk past them but they became aware that something was wrong.

As we got to the end of the train we had to start running to reach the end but were still joking about how many cheap tropes were play.
