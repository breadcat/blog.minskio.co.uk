title: Lidl warehouse training

I had opted for a job at Lidl, but had to attend a training seminar in a huge warehouse before I could start.

We weren't given any kind of instruction for how to get in, which we assumed was part of the test before the training started.

After walking around various places and being told about how things worked we were given a task to photoshop the teachers face out of a classical painting.

We all took it in turns as there was only one computer. I went first but forgot to invert the final image so got another go because my photoshopping skills were that good.
I took about 10 minutes to erase 25 pixels with the another trainer commenting on my performance saying it was the best he'd ever seen a candidate perform.
