I was staying at a large chateau in Norway with many other airbnbers, speaking with the guy who owned and ran the place.

I mentioned that there were no trains in Norway and he explained that I just didn't know where the station was and then gave me a breakfast of a waffle covered in maple syrup, sandwiched between large slices of shreddies.

I ended up skiing on a frozen lake that was crystal clear but lightly covered by snow and when you dusted off the surface you could read things under the frozen water.
