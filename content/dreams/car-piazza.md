I was driving in Leeds at night in my new company car and while traversing a large roundabout a car on my right side collided with me but only at slow speed.

I gestured that we should both pull over but the other car drove off so I gave chase, flashing my lights trying to get them to stop.

Eventually I lost the car I was trying to follow but another car behind me started flashing me so I pulled over to the side of the road where two girls got out and handed me a small piece of plastic trim from the right of my car that could be slotted back in place quite easily however the entire front of the car was missing its body panels so it was just a bare engine block and headlights.

I asked the two girls who'd flagged me down where they picked up the single piece of my car from and they just vaguely gestured behind them.

I got back in my car and started driving in the direction they'd gestured however there was now a crowd of people in the road that was now more like a piazza sat at tables and chairs eating and drinking and I needed to perform a three-point without knocking into any body.
