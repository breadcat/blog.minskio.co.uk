title: Alarming journal
dream: undated

I 'woke up' with vague, non-specific memories of a dream I'd just had. When I grabbed this book to start writing down my experience I flicked through it to find an available page but couldn't find a single free page. Even the margins and free spaces for short dreams had been entirely filled with handwriting that looked like my mothers.

While I continued searching for space, I heard an alarm noise sounding, so looked over to my computer where the noise was emanating to see that the time was 09:00. I looked for my phone to call the office to tell them I was running late but woke up for real to find the time was actually the usual 07:30.
