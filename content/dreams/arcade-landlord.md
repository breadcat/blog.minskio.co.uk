I was in Huddersfield with a few of my friends at a rented house near an arcade that was being let by a bitter old lady who didn't seem to like our group from the moment she saw us.

She would start arguments and complain about little things like leaving an empty bowl of soup near a couch while still being sat on said couch. To try remedy this I took the empty bowl to an outside tap to rinse it with water but as I crouched down and started filling the bowl I was pushed over by the woman who then started arguing with me resulting in her swinging at me with a gardening tool in her hand as a makeshift knuckle duster. I dodged this and hit her back square in face which she seemed to shrug like it was nothing.

She then went on to list off unusual statistics on her fingers from the games we'd been playing in the arcade next door such as most time spent as a father figure and most time spent playing on the Game Boy Advance. The results of these were both the same person. <!-- TH -->
