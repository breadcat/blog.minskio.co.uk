I was in the process of driving somewhere to donate blood, however I also needed to take my fictional dog to the dentists for whatever reason. I had to pull over on the side of the road to get my dog anaesthetized by a man in a white coat who was wielding a needle and a gas cannister.

After the anaesthetist administered the sedatives, he began giving me long winded and confusing instructions about how to get to the dentist. While this was going on, my dog which was laying down on the ground began to stretch out lengthways. I put him on the back seat of my car as fast as I could as he continued to stretch out and curl up at the edges until he became curved like a banana.
