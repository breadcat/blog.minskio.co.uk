I was on holiday with my girlfriend in a Latin American country that could have been Brazil. We were staying in a complex made out of stacked up shipping containers and napping in the sun.

While people slept, everyone on earth was told via dreams about a species of tiny parasites that had invaded earth, enriching peoples lives with better physical and mental attributes and would usher in world peace under their rule
This was entirely at the behest of the host though, and they would only enrich willing people. They also mentioned that every single person they'd invaded was grateful, and how things made sense, clicked and how life was much better now.

We both awoke at similar times, my girlfriend had accepted the parasites whereas I hadn't.
