I was called to P.E. by my teacher <!-- MK --> it was a swimming lesson in the lower gym (this room has no pool) however just below the liquid surface of the pool it was otherwise entirely frozen.

We decided as a class to place some inflatable obstacle courses in a grid pattern but they were all built like they were designed on isometric paper.

To make the course more difficult, as most students were able to easily complete the course the teacher started shooting the students with a NERF gun in an effort to make more students fail.
