Me and two other guys I didn't know were in a Swedish facility that looked like a [GoldenEye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(1997_video_game)) level.

There were guard clones attacking us at various stages of completion wearing face covering masks that increased their powers and abilities when worn.

We raced past low level clone guards in an attempt to either escape, or destroy the 'master clone' that would disable all the remaining clones.
