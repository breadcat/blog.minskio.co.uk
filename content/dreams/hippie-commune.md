I was in a weird hippie type compound that was based around a large warehouse with tribal style music and campfires outside and maybe a hundred people all partying and having a good time.

Part of their so called *spiritual awakening* involved smoking a floppy looking herb that looked like a combination of lavender and asparagus and once done you entered a psychedelic state.

In this state everything was moving and warping around and you had to remain as calm as possible and embrace the experience.

One woman near me gave birth on a table in the warehouse and one guy in a wheelchair started to walk, then freak out and turned into a bundle of dead grass.
