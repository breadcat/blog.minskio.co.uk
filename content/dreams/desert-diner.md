I was driving a school friend <!-- JH --> and a girl I didn't recognise along a dusty desert road in a 50's esque cruiser car with barely working brakes.

My friend was criticising my driving after we had to swerve to avoid hitting a steam train on a crossing due to the brakes, so later when we pulled up at an old portacabin type restaurant with a garage attached I said he could drive to shut him up.

While inside we ordered chili and rice which cost nothing and while this was being prepared, another guy I knew from work <!-- JtM --> pulled up outside disembarking from a greyhound bus carrying a duffel bag.

After the food had been served up, it was too hot to eat so while we waited for it to cool my school friend took the car along an impossibly winding dirt road path at high speed.
