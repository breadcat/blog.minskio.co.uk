I was attending a training course at a large business park with 40+ units however none of them seemed to have any bathrooms, or ones that did seemed to charge an admission fee of about &pound;10 which I found extortionate.

While continuing to look, I visited a small Tesco express to pick up some 9v batteries, I picked up 2 packs then asked a member of staff if there were any bathrooms for customers. She said no, however told me there was a bathroom in unit 30. I made my way there however when I got there it was another paid stall that I'd already tried earlier in the day.

While walking away from unit 30 I saw a strange black door with a small sign reading 'Tactical'. A woman in body armour came through the door and I tried to catch it but didn't want to make it seem too obvious and missed the timing so it closed with a loud clunk. I kicked the door and noticed it moved a little. Through kicking it more, and trying the handle I was able to loosen the latch and finally let myself in. Inside was just a single room with a urinal that I started walking towards, however before I got there another woman in body armour yelled at me and started arguing about how if everyone abused the system nobody would have anything. I apologised, and moved on.

Eventually I reached another supermarket surrounded by trees and dry grass, in the lot there were about 20 camper vans parked up. This supermarket had a single male and female toilet that were both in use and with queues so I knew I'd be there a while. I got into the queue with my girlfriend and we were approached by a hippie looking woman with a dog that we were both stroking and fussing with.

Eventually as the sun began to set I reached the end of the queue and entered the bathroom. Inside the floor was covered in patches of a thick dark liquid, and for some reason I didn't want to get my boots dirty so took them off where I wearing thick white socks underneath. I tried stepping around the patches of liquid but couldn't avoid them all and as it soaked into the socks it turned a dark red colour.
