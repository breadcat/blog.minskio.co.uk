I was in an airport, but had an unloaded 1911 pistol in a manilla envelope that I'd received for some reason from a bank tellers desk near the checkin area.

I was brazen about taking it through security. In the departure lounge I let some random guy hold it and he dry fired it against his temple.

I got to security and a worker with a big white moustache called *The Walrus* was asking questions but eventually let me through with the gun.
