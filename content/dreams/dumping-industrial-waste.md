title: Dumping industrial waste
dream: undated
---

I was the owner of a red brick end terrace house that looked out over a lake.

People swam in the lake but industrial waste tipping was a big problem so me and my girlfriend logged details of when this was happening so we could report them to the police.

Base on these logged details, some chavs came to my failing car showroom business and threatened to damage the cars. I started a fight with one of them and the rest ran off.
