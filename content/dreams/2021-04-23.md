I was conducting a site survey at a farm, installing a single phone in a barn that was quite some distance away from the main office site.

There were large multi-storey stone built barns as far as the eye could see and they were all in a rundown condition. One of the barns I walked through had thick chains curtain as its wall instead of the usual large stone blocks.

The customer, a middle aged woman showed me where this barn was and we walked for hours and hours to get to the destination. Once there, the customer said there was a shortcut back and took me in a cable car that went over a large multi-coloured autumnal forest.
