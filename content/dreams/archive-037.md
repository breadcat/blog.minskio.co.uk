I was dropping off a parcel for work so was staying at home untl a little later in the morning until the post office opened up.

My father had already tried shooting a rabbit earlier and missed, I saw the same black and white rabbit outside my window and took a shot at it using the air rifle, hitting it but not killing it.

I look up after it had run off and saw that it was ten past ten and I was significantly later for work.
