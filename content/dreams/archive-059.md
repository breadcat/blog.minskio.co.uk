A chavvy family that lived near me were in posession of multiple dangerous dogs that would regularly bark loudly.

I was around at their house for whatever reason, the dog was quite large and fat and had an unreasonable amount of sharp teeth and would playfully snap at my legs as I sat down in an arm chair.

As I was leaving, the dog indicated that it wanted to go out for a walk but nobody in the house could be bothered to let it out and they argued about whose responsibility it was, the other two dogs in the house were running around yapping.
