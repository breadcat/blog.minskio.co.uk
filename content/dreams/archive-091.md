I'm staying at my grandparents house, I'm aware that there's something not quite right with the world and in my dreams I'm being followed by voilent gangs of teenagers but I know it's not real.
When I wake up to write down the dream, the world is different again and people refuse to acknowledge the existence of this book and it's contents.

I'm now in a futuristic black, white and red house themed house surrounded by a dark red desert with brown cactuses.
I'm looking through a large, black chest of drawers attempting to find the power plug for a lamp that's on but can't be turned off. There's also a blonde pale skinned woman in the house with me but we both know that none of this is real.
