As part of our college work we had to scavenge old, broken and unused laptops, desktops and servers and see what would successfully boot up. First one to see a desktop won, as it was also a competition.

I tried with a server but couldn't get around a BIOS password so tried a Pentium 3 laptop that booted up first time and even played the welcome to windows jingle. The teacher declared me the winner.

On the laptops screen was some unfinished erotic literature, In the documents were low resolution pictures of Nina Hartley and an 'Erotic Adventure Extravaganza' 3D adventure game.

We had a laugh at this and were told to get started working on another computer after the laughter had died down enough.
