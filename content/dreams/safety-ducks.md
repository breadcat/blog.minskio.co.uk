I was a local TV news reporter reporting on an effort to save endangered ducks from being caught in rapids, fishing lines and nets.

The effort involved training specially selected ducks to wear hi-vis jackets and helmets with flashing lights on their heads to move, but not scare off other ducks.

A guy I was interviewing was impressed with the scheme and was repeatedly saying "I bet you've never seen ducks like these, eh?"
