I was with one of my friends <!-- RH --> and his dad in Huddersfield when we were talking about Pok&eacute;mon game remasters and modding them to make them a single player experience. The father piped up that Pok&eacute;mon was 'gay' but said this in a strange accent so we made fun of him for it.

We walked back to another friends house <!-- JH --> laughing about how his dad had pronounced gay. Outside this house was a small pile of old and dirty [Samsung DS-5000](https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=isch&q=samsung%20ds-5000%20phone) series phones that I chuckled at before ignoring them.

I let myself into this second friends house to find him watching [Fawlty Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawlty_Towers) imitating [Manuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_(Fawlty_Towers)) accent before my first friend called my second friend gay.
