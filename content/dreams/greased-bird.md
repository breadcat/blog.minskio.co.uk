I was returning from a holiday in a Mediterranean town that featured cobbled streets and terracotta tiled roofs, trying to arrange an airport transfer at a small office with white UPVC windows when there was word amongst the staff and customers waiting of some kind of black creature loose on the streets.

Most people immediately starting running away but I decided to stay and help with a friend of mine<!-- ST --> from the pub quiz. As the dark shape lunged towards us outside, I managed to capture it in kind of formal suit jacket I was wearing and the creature turned out too be a massive scabby looking black bird with greasy feathers.

We struggled and struggled pushing the whole mass up a hill and then there was an award ceremony afterwards for everyone who was supposedly involved, however most had nothing to do with the event and hadn't helped at all. As their roles were read out they features titles like mayors driver, witness and travel agent office landlord.

As I approached the stage to receive my award, I was told it was a gin and tonic, that I didn't really want and that they'd already run out of slices of lemon.
