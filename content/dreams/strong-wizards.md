I was walking with a group of friends past a rival school. Feeling a little mischievous, we'd agreed to try and mess with then, magically.

Our first plan was to try and turn something into stone. The spell we used was *illustro* but it didn't seem to work on inanimate objects.

We then picked out a male student through a window and shot a bolt at him, hitting him in the chest. Seeing us through the window laughing, he stormed out of the classroom and appeared outside holding a shovel. He the proceeded to catapult loose items around him in our direction using the shovel.

We pick out another student to try and mess with, but the first student rushed towards us, tackling my friend who initially cast the bolt to the ground all while trying to strangle him with handle of the shovel.
