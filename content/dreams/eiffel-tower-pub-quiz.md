Me and a friend <!-- TH --> were on a pub quiz team together against a second team of my other friends, <!-- RH HP OL --> and his wife. 

You were given a load of questions already on one side of paper before opening an enevelope containing the subject of the questions. It was the Eiffel Tower and we didn't know any of them as they weren't interesting things, just copy/paste statistics from Wikipedia.

We didn't get any questions right but my friends' wife knew every answers without any issues.
