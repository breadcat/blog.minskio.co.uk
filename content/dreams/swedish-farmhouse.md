I was holidaying in Sweden and had somehow arranged to stay in ia mostly dilapidated stone farmhouse with attached barn.

The barn was owned by a stereotypical looking metal band who had used it to record the music video to the song [Instability by Dragged Under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXUxGEawNkg).

The main building space was empty with a dirt floor however there was a small room to the side with three lit open fires in each wall that functioned as a boiler room cum chimney.

While we organized paying rent for the duration of the stay, they were sat outside in an ambulance that they'd technically stolen as it was only a few days from being decommissioned and was covered inside and outside in a layer of thick black soot.

The ambulances' glove box there was a clear plastic syringe in a sealed clear plastic bag that contained some kind of cancer medication that I needed for someone for some reason.
