This dream had a twinge of the Green Mile, magic and redemption.

There was a soft spoken, but burley black guy who had been imprisoned for a crime he hadn't commit.

He was able to somehow talk psychically with an effeminate lawyer type via a kind of invisible pouch he could open on his waist.

If the prisoner was left alone, and ignored, and no progress was made on his case he would fall further and further into this pouch literally being further and further from freedom.

The dream revolved around the free man opening the pouch while walking in a heavy rain storm to reveal good news, as he starts talking with the prisoner he climbs closer and closer to the opening of the pouch until he is just able to reach out and is able to brush his fingers with the lawyer on the outside when he says he's able to finally prove his innocence and free him.
