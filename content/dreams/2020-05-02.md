I was in a large American style house that was dimly lit using neon lights. The main room was large but had branching rooms coming off it with a single person inside who would give you a riddle and you had to whistle the correct answer into a microphone.

The second rooms question master didn't know what his song was or what the clue meant (It was Taps) so he just badly whistled it himself meaning we got the full 3 points, minus 1 for the help he gave us.

After we finished the house section we walked along an American boulevard type street filled with other people from the house but we'd been given neon canes as it was dark outside. These canes could be remotely collapsed via remote controlled explosives.
