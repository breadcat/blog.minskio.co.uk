I was eating a meal with my family at a large brick pub in Doncaster. Outside there was a bit of a commotion going on with police cars parked up and stopped traffic. It was all surrounding a young woman driving a blue tractor who had stopped in the middle of a road junction with cars all slowly diverting around her.

There were multiple police offers around the tractor, trying to talk to the woman. My mum turned to me and said that this kind of thing had been happening more and more often these days and then the tractor took off, confronting a row of cars at the junction before running over the drivers side of 3 vehicles while the drivers scrambled around trying and failing to get out of their vehicles.
