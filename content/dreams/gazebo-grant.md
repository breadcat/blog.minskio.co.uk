I was at my girlfriends parents house with her family and my dad for some reason.

Her younger brother was cooking on a BBQ grill and then serving that food in tubes of bamboo segments with the tougher green skin sliced away.

I'd offered to help with this job, so me and my dad were delicately hacking away at raw bamboo shoots with machetes.

My girlfriends brother then declared this was a slow way of doing the job then produced a plastic gadget that you'd feed bamboo lengths into, then intricately set up guides for, and then run a small plastic chainsaw over multiple times until the thick bark layer was removed but the finished product was rough and splintered.

My girlfriends mum made fun of him for buying tat on Amazon and he sulked off back to the grill
