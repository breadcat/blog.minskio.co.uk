I was staying at my parents house when I heard somebody pruning the trees in the back garden with a chainsaw. After they've finishing this they and a group of other people gather and start playing in the adjoining field.

I go outside, to talk to the players and when I make eye contact with unknown tree surgeon he throws the ball against the house, catching it on the rebound.

The rest of the baseball team is made up of:
* My old scout master <!-- C -->
* The houses windowcleaner
* [Colin, from Ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(TV_series)#Characters)
* The two farmers who live behind the house
