A strange dream about working in a museum in an African plain who were in the process of releasing a new exhibit simply titled 'It's Shit' which focused on how life and death were cyclical in nature and life revolves around individual processes working together.

There were big models, demonstrating how life worked and guided tours available. We were just about to open up the exhibit and everyone that worked on it though it was very clever.
