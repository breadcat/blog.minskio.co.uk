I was in an old pub playing pool with an incomplete set of balls which meant we had to remove some from both sides to even out things. When the table was set up the pool triangle was also set at a jaunty angle.

We broke the rack and while playing noticed there was a children's stop motion TV show on a large wall mounted TV about a mouse who went on adventures in the mountains wearing a green shirt and the theme song mentioned "a mighty mouse, with the purest heart".
