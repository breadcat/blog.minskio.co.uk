I was on an evening out with friends but needed to stop in at home quickly to pick up something, or do something so everyone carried on while me and my friend <!-- CD --> made a stop at my house.

When I arrived and opened the door everything was very subtlety different, my curtain rail was no longer mounted to the wall and was laid down on top of my radiator, there were pieces of plastic loaded into the washing machine and the order and sizes of my fridge shelves had moved and there was extra half eaten food and opened drinks left inside.

Outside in the courtyard there was a few surprisingly small cars that I didn't recognise that were all parked haphazardly.
