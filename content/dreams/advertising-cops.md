I was in Florida with a group of people I didn't really know. We were all students in a kind of college course where the final test of the semester was to come up with an advertising speil.

I hadn't prepared at all, however all the other students presentations were very dry so I wasn't too concerned.

When it got to my time, I spent the first minute very shakily reitterating the initial brief while reading through it before flourishing the advert, making wild claims, puns, advances to the teacher and making the other students laugh.

This went down extremely well and I was finished the students and teacher applauded and wooped. To celebrate we decided to go to the city for a night out.

As we were driving we came to a T-junction where our entrance was angled and the driver didn't seem very confident and people in the car were offering mixed messages on whether to go or not, and we eventually pulled out in front of a car who honked at us and flashed their lights.

Due to this we jumped out and saw a queue forming at a house. The queue was long and snaked around the houses veranda being separated by a red velvet rope. We jumped in at the head, sneaking past the bouncer who happened to be Xzibit.

Xzibit was looking a bit tired and fed up, especially when one of the students asked him if he really was _the_ Xzibit which he confirmed. Xzibit then got on his walkie-talkie and called security as we'd jumped the line.

An officer came up, asked the group a few questions and described me as being a "white, male, 25" which we all found extremely funny and we replied that she wasn't very good at her job which she wasn't impressed with before leaving.

Another one of our student friends appeared asking what was going on, so we told her, before she flashed us her badge; revealing she was also a cop and we were going to be booked.
