We were playing a game as a group of around five people where you had to draw a card then act on what was written on the card.

The game quicky devolved into people violently attacking each other indiscriminately with one person who I did not know called Emma stabbing four screwdrivers into another girls' <!-- Dodger --> abdomen.

After a large argument everyone moved their beds and belongings to form defensive cliques. I was in the same room as Emma but on a different side but not by choice.

The girl who'd been stabbed was with me and told me not to trust Emma as "Emmas' been the traitor before, she will be the traitor again".
