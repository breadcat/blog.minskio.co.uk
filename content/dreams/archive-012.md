A group of about 20 of us from high school were driving around London in a large VW van that had been used by three of the group of friends<!-- CD, AG, AW --> as a tour bus for their band.

As we drove, instruments and equipment wer ebeing set up and tuned and there were speakers and amps in the van.

We were staying at a hotel in a cul-de-sac and the band were going to play there.

Before the band played as a group we all agreed to have a meal at a fancy restaurant in a tower near the cul-de-sac but there was a strict dress code. All the members of staff there were wearing pyjamas underneath pieces of uniform.
