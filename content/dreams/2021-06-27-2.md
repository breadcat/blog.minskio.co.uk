I was in America sat on a roundabout surrounded by a metre wide ring of dying bushes trying to remember a song I'd heard previously.

I'm holding a blue pair of flush angle snips and every time I cut through a branch, I hear a couple of seconds of [the song I'm trying to recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkfSrLIxEuI).

As I'm trying to listen to the lyrics two policemen come up behind me, then roughly carry me under my arm before throwing me into a futuristic looking police car.
