I was in a large hotel that was connected to an airport and a number of other buildings like a sports centre, large library and school.

We were given a list of tasks and different difficulty tiers which reflected the rewards you'd receive for completing them with their associated crimes next to each tier.

Some people had been told about the tier system before so had a head start, so we were like under dogs.

We were running in the sports centre with hockey sticks when we had to get from one corridor to another before another team caught up to us.

We opted to take the vandalism and criminal damage tier by breaking the reinforced glass window separating the corridors with our hockey sticks. Before we knew about this a guy from our group kicked me in the ribs for early points as he'd been given extra challenges.
