I was collecting some items for work from a large warehouse in Lancashire. When I arrived I was told there was a full pallet to collect and then went off to sort some paperwork that needed signing.

I tried to explain I only need a few items that should only come to around the size of a medium box but was shown a pallet full of junk items that had been ordered wrong and were just sat there waiting indefinitely.

One of the items was a about 30 lengths of really chunky trunking that were all cut at 45&deg; angles that were only about 30cm long rendering them useless.

There was also a frozen joint of meat that I eagerly took away and planned to eat for my tea that night.
