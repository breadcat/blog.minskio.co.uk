I was in an Italian coastal town with a group of other people I didn't know.
The streets were narrow, cobbled and very step. We were on a tour with segways that were connected horizontally through their axels and needed pedalling to move which was extremely difficult.

One hill that we went up had a plateau that had an ice cream shop on it, where we stopped to all get ice creams.

Eventually we made it to the top and there was a large modern hall with dark blue curtains covering the windows, there was a casino and bar inside.

I was getting a drink when people started talking about a large muscular man called 'mister jab jab'. He would come up being people in a queue and punch them in the back of the head to steal their place in the queue.
