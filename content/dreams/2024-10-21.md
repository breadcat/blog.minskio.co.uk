I was at a house on the American coast with some non-descript family members that weren't my actual family.

To get to this house you drove down a road, entered a gate and at the fork in the road, we were on the right. On the left fork was an exclusive fishing club with sunken ponds the size of tennis courts surrounded by sun bleached white stone.

For some reason the rest of the family were taken into this club and held prisoner so me and a group of Australian backpackers broke in and tried to rescue them but this involved traversing a rocky coastline and the group started arguing about why the plan was so bad.
