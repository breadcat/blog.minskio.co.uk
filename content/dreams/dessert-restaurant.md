I was on holiday in a far-eastern country in the 90's. I asked a rickshaw driver to drive around and show me the sights but instead he drove me straight to a restaurant that only served desserts.

I tried to explain that I didn't want any as they were all huge and covered with various glazes and chocolate spreads but he seemed personally insulted that I didn't want to try one of his favourite desserts.
