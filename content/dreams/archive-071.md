I was in an office, similar in layout and style to [KF-Offices](https://killingfloormod.fandom.com/wiki/KF-Offices). Downstairs there were rows of plasterboards with a forklift truck moving them around.

As I entered this room, the forklift truck collided with the side of knocked itself and the row of plasterboards over. After checking everyone was alright I walked upstairs.

In one room I entered I saw my aunt and uncle sleeping so knew the room I was staying in was further down the corridor. As I approached this room and tried opening this door I stuggled and in the process woke up my mother who was staying in the room next to mine. She came up to me and said "Well, you know what you've done, don't you?".
