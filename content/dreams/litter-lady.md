I was visiting a friend who had recently moved house to an old Victorian style terrace. He had a new girlfriend who'd moved in and this was to be the first time I'd ever met her. He'd already warned me she was a bit crazy but was hoping to work things out in the future. For some reason I was roped into cleaning out her cats litter trays but she had an extremely specific way of doing this, with certain bags, brushes and trays needing to be used with everything ultimately being binned versus recycled.

I entered the house and did things mostly her way but with a few optimisations and shortcuts here and there I thought I could get away with. I heard a noise upstairs but left it be, then found out she was in the house spying on me making sure I followed her plan to the letter. Eventually I just left as her demands are bordering on ridiculous. My friend then told me he was going to break up with her and things weren't working out.
