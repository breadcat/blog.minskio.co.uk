I was at a friends <!-- SC --> house that while that same overall layout, was incredibly ornately furnished with marble water features, fountains interspersed with jets of flame and free standing bath tubs around in most rooms. All the internal walls were matte black bricks with white mortar and the floors had thick white shaggy rugs scattered around them.

The house was full of women who were all preparing to go to an airport to travel abroad so there was luggage, clothing and toiletries scattered everywhere and the houses owner was also very made up, wearing a slinky black dress.

I was wandering around looking for a bathroom in a room I knew had an en suite but this had been replaced with more elaborate water features. I was looking to find the owner to ask where the bathroom had moved to, trying to avoid getting in peoples way but still inevitably doing so.
