I was in a city trying to talk to an old homeless looking man who whenever he would open his mouth to speak would produce bursts of static instead of speech. These static bursts didn't correspond to the rhythm of conversation or even his jaw movements.

After getting frustrated with him I woke up to find the intermittent static noise was actually my girlfriend snoring.
