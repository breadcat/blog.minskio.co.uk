Me and a group of my friends <!-- JH JM TH --> were out in a town that looked like Pudsey, for whatever reason early into the evening we decided to take a single ecstasy pill and were just beginning to feel its effects.

One of my friends <!-- JH --> said that he needed us to roll him two joints so we sat down in a booth and me and another friend <!-- JM --> tried our best to roll the joints with large eucalyptus leaves that the friend insisted we use instead of papers.

We were both struggling and some locals on a nearby table were offering advice in a good mannered way.
