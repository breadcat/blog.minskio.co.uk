I was in my second year of sixth form on my first day of the school year, I'd poorly planned and had a load of camping equipment in my backpack that was useless and about four or five old wooden rulers.

My first class was English Literature and I barely understood what was going on and nobody would help me, not even the smart girl <!-- CS --> who I was sat next to.

Eventually I got the gist of things, and knew we had to finish a generic fantasy story that had already been started. I had ideas for how to complete the work but my pens' ink was really really faint so I couldn't read any of the notes I'd made.
