I was driving my car through a rough part of my town and had to disturb a load of kids who were playing in the road to get through. Some threw snowballs and balls at the car, whereas others just gave me funny looks.

After that were were a lot of dogs roaming around, after seeing three wanting to get out of the road I asked somebody who was doing gardening by the side of the road where they'd come from but she didn't know.

As I drove past a school, a woman drove through a crossroad without slowing down and hit my car. She swerved to the side and stopped, but started talking to dog walkers completely ignoring me.

I continued driving and two farmers in land rovers ran into me before jokingly telling me to watch out before, being I was berated by dog walkers for my car being in pieces all over the road.
