I was in a tavern up on a Scottish island overhearing a subtitled conversation in Gaelic between two patrons. One was asking about the others tribe because his accent was unusual but he explained he'd learnt Gaelic online.

They mentioned a solstice festival of sorts with a special board game and dancing. A girl from work <!-- AM --> is with me for whatever reason and loves dancing in the circle with others.

I stand on an overhanging balcony and somebody mentions that most girls are very good at cheating at the board game which is precisely what the girl from work does.
