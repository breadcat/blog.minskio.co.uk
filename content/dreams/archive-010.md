I was in a snowy mountainous region of France pretending to be Rosemund Pike's boyfriend so she could assassinate somebody.

For some reason her father came round and started serenading me in German. I ended up bear-hugging him so that he stopped singing and instead said "We don't usually do this kind of thing on our vacations!" in a thick German accent.

There were hidden messages in love letter that told Rosemund details of who and where to assassinate her target.
