The world has been overtaken by large and powerful monkeys, ala Planet of the Apes.

I was with the original [cast of Dad's Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad%27s_Army#Characters) planning to storm the gym and sports area of my high school.

For some reason [Private Frazer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Frazer) had decided that he would create a large explosion using a blowtorch and some pieces of metal piping.

The apes didnt' seem particularly violent and one even helped me personally enter the building.

We also made a cup of tea by boiliong water on a wood burning stove in one of the corridors.
