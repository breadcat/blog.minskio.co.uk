I was driving to to a care home site as part of my job with my girlfriend in the car. For some reason I was wearing tigh fitting ear plugs.

When we arrived I produced my work phone to assign myself as having arrived on site however saw that I had a job in the next few days in [Bournemouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth) that looked like hundreds of miles away.

I walked up to the entrance of the care home, before sitting on a bench to remove the ear plugs. As I removed the plugs I saw that they were caked with dirt, wax and a crumbly white substance.

My girlfriend had sat down next to me and then started yanking my ear lobe to try to clear out any other obstructions.
