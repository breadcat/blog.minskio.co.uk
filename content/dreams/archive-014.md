I was at my friends house<!-- JM --> but the road to it had collapsed in certain parts and had been replaced with much steeper and sharper curving sections of road.

My cousin<!-- MH --> was also there for whatever reason wearing a bloodied shirt, complaining about the food that had been supplied.

A girl who was a neighbour had made some coleslaw but nobody in the family liked it so I ended up taking the whole bowl home after an awkward buffet tea after not a single person liked a single thing on offer.
