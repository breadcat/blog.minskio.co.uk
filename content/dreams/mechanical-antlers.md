I was going through a carboard box if old things in my attic (that my house doesn't have) where I found a small statue of a reindeer with long flowing antlers and a mechanical system that extended the antlers out even more by using part of an antler as a winch.

I'd given it to one of my friends who had told me he'd had wild dreams when you slept near it, with candles lit, so I visited his house to try this out. We winched the antlers to full length and I went to sleep in a small single bed with white bedding. I woke with my girlfriend beside me, shaking me awake saying we needed to leave right now.

It was raining and we were running through back streets looking for a place to get out of the rain. We ran past her workplace but her keycard wouldn't let her in over the weekend. We continued running and ended up at a school building that she knew and we entered a side door where a load of kids were there who'd also used the building to get away from the now torrential downpour.
