I'd decided to go and visit a chain of Scottish islands that were all connected via bridges after watching a [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/@TomScottGo) video about them.

The body of water happened to be tidal but calm so I went for a swim there with the dogs, venturing out into the water.

Eventually the tide started to come in through a narrow gap at one end of the loch as waves were crashing around me.

I tried turning back but there was a lot of people behind me doing the same thing with panicked looks on their faces
