I was driving at night around a ring road when I drove past a car that had been rear ended by another car. There was a police car at the scene and a transporter for the damaged car.

I drove past this and a little further on there was collection of 3 road signs warning of upcoming road works, however one of these signs was missing so just the frame was lying in the road but as it was dark I had to swerve to avoid it. Thinking this was potentially pretty dangerous I indicated then started to slow down to pull over.

I was then rear ended by a white BMW SUV. I tried to find the dashcam to save the recording of what had happened but it was really far away from the usual location and I had to reach. As I got out of the car, the woman in the car behind also got out and her first words were "Where were you?" to which I replied "In front of you". Moments later, the police car from earlier pulled up to investigate what was going on.
