Me and my girlfriend were renting a warehouse for whatever reason when we were approached by another person to sub-let this for a violent version of polo called murder-ball or something similar where one end of your club hits the ball and the other ned has a hammer/tazer type contraption.

During the first match at our warehouse a couple of people died and my girlfriend refused to tidy up the corpses when asked to.

The warehouse owner came around to inspect his warehouse and found a body and then proceeded to kill my girlfriend by hitting her with her own club while she sat on a staircase.

I was this and grabbed my trench coat to use my phone which was inside to call the police.
