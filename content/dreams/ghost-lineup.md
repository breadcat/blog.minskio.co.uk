I was in an old abandoned house that was also inhabited by a large number of ghosts. They were mostly harmless however if you riled them up for whatever reason there was a possibility that they could attack you.

The group of people I was with would take it in turns to walk *safe* premade paths through this house, documenting the changes to the ghosts inside with video cameras.

There was an old couple of ghosts that didn't realize they were dead and just wanted to talk to you, so you had to walk quickly away from them otherwise you'd be trapped in a conversation that would never end.

There was also a clown who looked a little like Krusty who would grab ahold of you with both arms then collapse to the side pulling you through the floor into a deeper layer of this ghost house realm.

Finally there was also an old french woman from the 1930s who would recognise and target me as soon as she saw me. The group I was with would inform me via radio that she was hunting me down and I'd need to speed up to avoid interacting with her.
