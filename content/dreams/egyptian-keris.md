I was in an Egyptian themed bedroom room on a four poster bed with silken drapes adorning the corners. The room was actually pyramid shaped and focused to a point in the ceiling.

There was a women also dressed in a silken dress who would offer a selection of weapons from a rotating holographic lazy Susan. There were knives that weren't butterfly knives but physically shaped like literal butterflies, sabres and a keris.

I selected the keris and the woman's mouth turned into an enlarged circle about three times larger than it otherwise could have opened and she coughed and choked up the blade (pointed end first) from her throat onto the bed where it lay covered in saliva.
