I was staying at an old hotel in the [Yorkshire Dales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Dales) with about 10 other guests who were all there on the hunt for a mysterious diamond that had been believed to exist but had been lost to time.

As a group, me and the other guests solved a bundle of problems while navigating around rooms. Some of the puzzles required multiple people to work together, lifting pieces of string while holding objects out of the way so the string could move freely to release further mechanisms in the puzzle.

Eventually a map showed us what we believed we had the location of the diamond, however it indicated it was in a cellar near an underground stream that had since been eroded away.

The hotel also featured a kind of miniature museum with a scale model of the building and the surrounding area, I took a chisel and started digging into this chalky model in which I found the diamond in the place the map had indicated.
