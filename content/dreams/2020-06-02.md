I was in a busy bar with a number of people from my past and Stephen Fry who was practicing telling dirty jokes for a game show where you competed against a computer.

I was buying drinks however every time I went up to the bar to order, the price and complexity of the drink would increase and whenever you even queried the drink they'd start making it for you.

I only discovered this when the barmaid began breaking Oreo biscuits apart for a chocolate stout I'd queried that looked more like a hot chocolate/milkshake/mocha with squirty cream on top and chocolate shavings.

I questioned if this was how things were done at the bar, and the barman with dreadlocks enthusiastically agreed, telling me how good my choice was.
