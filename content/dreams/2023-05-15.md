I was in a noisy club with a load of people I didn't know, I wasn't intentionally there so was wearing my steel work boots which everyone seemed mildly fascinated with.

At one point I had a guy standing on each one of my boots when one person was pushed over and I fell over, underneath everyone.

Everyone was laughing as they'd been drinking and the music was loud and another person jumped on as well thinking it was a game.

As more and more people joined in I was buried deeper and deeper beneath the people, struggling to breath and shouting to be let up without anybody really being able to hear me.
