Hi, my name's Peter.

This blog is a rambling and verbose journey into my interests, journeys, problems, solutions and stances.

As you'd expect from someone that ~~owns~~ rents their own server, I enjoy the usual nerdy ventures and generally try to self host the majority of online services I use.

Things I enjoy or embrace, in no particular order (albeit alphabetical) include:
* Anti-natalism
* Botany and Mycology
* Coffee culture
* Cooking and baking
* Cryptocurrency, especially [Nano](https://nano.org/) and [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/)
* Running
* Swimming
* GNU/Linux and free software in general
* INTJ Myersâ€“Briggs Indicator
* [Ketogenic food](/recipes/) and OMAD diets
* Lucid dreaming
* Minimalism
* Mycology and botany
* Napping
* [Nordic language](/languages/) and culture
* Paperless paperwork
* PC focused gaming including retro console and computer emulation
* [Pseudointellectual quotes](/quotes/)
* [Reading](/reading-list/)
* Rollercoasters and water parks
* Science, espcially physics and astronomy
* Scotch whisky and Irish whiskey
* Stoicism
* Universal Basic Income
* Watching assorted [movies](/archive/movies/) and [television](/archive/television/) (Archiving what I've watched so it doesn't take up space and resources)

Some people I find interesting or inspirational:
* Adam Curtis
* Aldous Huxley
* Bill Bryson
* Colin Furze
* Eddie Vedder
* James Randi
* Louis Theroux
* Marie Kondo
* Simon Singh

There are some actual places online however that you'll find me:

* [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/unholybanquet) - [Extended stats available here](https://duome.eu/unholybanquet)

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/risky-scribble/)
* [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/minskwhisker)
* [Telegram](http://telegram.me/carrion_regardless)

You'll likely find numerous typos, all pages are written without the use of a spell checker.
If you'd like to message me, my email address is incredibly easy to guess and probably listed on one of the above sites.
