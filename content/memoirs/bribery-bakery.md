While at college, on our usual walks to the usual [sandwich shop](/memoirs/yer-prawns/) we used to have to walk past a significantly more upmarket sandwich shop and the owners had obviously noticed the rabble of teenage boys with jingling change in their pockets each and every day walking past.

One day, on our way back we were ambushed by the owner of the shop who jumped out in front of us, thrusting a dainty package of assorted bakes goods at us, encouraging us to share them with our friends. We ate a good half of the box on our way back to college but did share the remaining sweet treats out later.

We did on a couple of occasions return to this fancier sandwich shop, but it was a monthly treat as opposed to the daily cheapo equivalent.
