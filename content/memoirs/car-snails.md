title: Car snails

While in college, out of our class of about 20 students everyone for the most part got along except for one person called Danny. He was an enormous guy, spoke with a thick accent and was just generally quite mean spirited in general.

We mostly stayed out of his way, but every now and again we'd plot and scheme a little to inconvenience him in whichever small ways we knew we could get away with.

This was in the middle of summer, and he owned a knackered old Toyota Avensis with a sun roof that he'd leave open on hot days to avoid the stifling heat of getting back in the car once college was over. While walking back from our usual [sandwich shop](/memoirs/yer-prawns/) we walked past a large metal gate that had hundreds of little snails crawling around it. We picked up a few by their shells, walked back to the college's car park and after a brief discussion, poked them through the gap in Danny's sun roof.

Nothing really came of this for a few days until one of our group let it slip and asked if he'd found more snails than usual in the car. He was furious, and actually smashed up the college a little while we were just laughing at him. I don't know if he ever did find any snails, but we must have put at least five in the car.
