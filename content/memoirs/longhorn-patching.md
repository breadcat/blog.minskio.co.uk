title: Longhorn patching
memoir: college

During and around college I closely followed the development of what [would eventually become Windows Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Windows_Vista), codenamed Longhorn. In a suspiciously similar vein to my earlier [WPA Patching](/memoirs/wpa-patching/) exploits I also created patches for every single publicly (available at the time I was active in the community) released build of Longhorn from the early 3000 series, through 4000 and eventually culminating in 5048.
