title: Double bus lane
memoir: working
---

I was working in Leeds programming and replacing a router for a new Internet connection, on my drive back I needed to turn left however the left lane was a bus lane. I drove a certain way down until I was fairly confident the bus lane had ended and turned left. No harm, no foul.

I ended up returning to the office, then needed to go back out as the replacement router didn't support as many VPN clients as the old router did. As I drove away on the same route, I followed my original route away and ended up being caught twice in one day, a couple hours apart and had to pay 2x &pound;60 fines.
