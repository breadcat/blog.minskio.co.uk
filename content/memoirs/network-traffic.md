Again, while at college we had managed to get a copy of Halo 1 onto the network and were playing multiplayer [Blood Gulch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Gulch) with reckless abandon. The administrator of the college stormed into the classroom and told us that she could see we were all playing games and we should knock it off. We all agreed to this before just starting up the next game immediately after the door was closed.
