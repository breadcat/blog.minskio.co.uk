While I was in high school, we'd heard rumours that you could miss lessons if you donated blood whenever the blood people visited in their truck.

Never one to turn down the possibility of a little skive here and there, I signed up during a science less and spent the next 30 minutes laid down in a chair donating blood, eating biscuits and feeling quite pleased with myself.

Since that day, I continued donating blood and legitimately look forward to my appointments.
