The junior school that I attended to was an old, sandstone, Victorian building. During lunches, me and a couple of my friends would play a game called *construction work* in which we'd take paperclips, unfold them and then slowly chisel away at the stonework of the building and playground.

One memory that really sticks out in my mind was of the group of three or four of us, one of us had decided to start this construction work on the head teachers offices' window sill which we all thought was risky, but very cool.
