I'd just arrived back from a week long holiday with my girlfriend. We were unloading the car and moving everythin from it back into the house. There was no space on the side of the road where the house was, so I was crossing the road for every trip.

The speed limit on the road was 30 mph and as I was carry the final piece, a pink suitcase across the road a white truck driving towards me seemed to speed up with me almost not making it across the road.

I mouthed towards the driver "slow down!". As he passed me, he slowed down to a complete stop, then wound down his window, then angrily asked me "what did you say me?". "Slow down" I replied.

"You should have sped up, you bald bastard!" was his reply, all in front of his daughter sat in a car seat on the passenger seat. The strength of his powerful and cutting comeback was entirely lost on me as drove away.
