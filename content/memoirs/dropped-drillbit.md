title: Dropped drillbit
memoir: nursery
---

The nursery I attended was train themed as it was next door to a train station, from what I recall the actual building itself was a couple of converted train carriages.
One lunch time, I was playing with a plastic drill that had interchangeable bits that would light up and make noise when you pulled the trigger.

While changing these drill bits I dropped one of them and the piece fell down a gap between the building and a staircase that wasn't especially well guarded against things like this happenening. The bright plastic bit contrasting against the gloomy staircase

I panicked knowing the full set of drill bits wouldn't be returned and was sure I'd get into trouble with the teachers.
