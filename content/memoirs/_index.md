A few short stories from my life, crudley categoriesed by time period. This all started after reading [Bob Mortimer's autobiography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57513156-and-away) and I decided to note down a few stories that stuck out in my mind.

As a rough guide, I don't remember anything from the 80's, I was in junior school during the 90's, high school and college in the 2000's, then started work around 2010.
