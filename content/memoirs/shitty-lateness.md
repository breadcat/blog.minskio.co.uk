While in sixth-form, we had a [fearsome science teacher](/memoirs/bnp-teacher/) who took no prisoners.

One of my friends in this class who was never the most punctual was around 10 minutes late one day for this class and when he bustled through the door this teacher demanded to know why the student was late.

Without hesitation, the student simply answered "I stood in some shit, sir". The class were all pretty taken aback with this frankness and expected the teacher to raise hell but he softened, shrugged and said "That's fair, take your seat" and nothing more was said on the matter
