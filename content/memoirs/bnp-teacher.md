While in Sixth Form, I had a moderate amount of respect for an eccentric science teacher who took no nonsense, spoke his mind and was overall a very matter of fact kind of guy.

Around this time, in 2008, there [was a leak of the BNP membership database](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/British_National_Party_membership_and_contacts_list,_2007-2008) that when searched contained this teachers name, address and phone number. We knew from general conversations we'd had with him that this was definitely him.
