title: The interview
memoir: college

As part of the college admissions process, we had a mock interview where I attended dressed in a suit and followed through like a legitimate job interview.

At one point of this, the interviewer asked me a couple of sample IT centric questions from a book he had. At no point did he indicate whether or not I'd answered them correctly so at the end of the interview I asked him if I'd got the questions correct. He gave me a vague shrug and replied that he didn't even know himself.
