title: Seagull sausage roll
memoir: working
---

I was spending a long weekend in Llandudno with my girlfriend, we'd had a few drinks and were walking back to the hotel.

Along the front were a number of other hotels and I was looking across them while we were walking and talking.

I caught the eye of a guy with his feet up on the open window frame and decided to wave at him, I mentioned this to my girlfriend who wasn't anywhere near as impressed as I seemed to be.

Being a seaside town, there also happened to be a seagull relaxing just outside his field of view. I pointed this out to him, at which point he brandished a small greaseproof paper bag, removing a sausage roll, tore off a corner then gestured as to whether he should feed the seagull of not.

At this point I was ectatic, cheering at the window and giving him two thumbs up. He threw the sausage roll corner to the seagull which devoured it and I cheered loudly for him.
