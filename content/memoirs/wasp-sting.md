title: Wasp sting
memoir: nursery
---

While at nursery, I remember playing out in the sun one day during a break. I was on a blue plastic tractor and an insect landed on the tractors' bonnet. Unbeknownst to me this insect was a wasp. I grabbed at the wasp managing to cup it in my hand when it inevitably stung me.

I remember the pain being unlike anything I'd ever experienced at that point and cried for a long time. To date, this is the only time I've been stung by a wasp or a bee.
