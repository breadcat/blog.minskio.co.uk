Out of the total class of maybe 20 pupils, maybe four actually had their own cars and it was seen as quite a prestigious thing as our viable lunch radius was greatly expanded. As we were also dickhead teenage boys, we also used to [mess about with these vehicles](/memoirs/car-snails/) at certain points.

One boy, known only as /Kenco/ as he was slightly tanned had a knackered old Ford which he was sat in one lunch time. We all huddled around the car, picking it up by the wheel arches and frog marched the entire vehicle between two bollards further back in the car park so the car was stuck without it being carried out again. With this we all walked away but were told off after lunch by the Colleges' administrator and told to return it to its' original parking spot.
