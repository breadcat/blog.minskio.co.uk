# Ingredients
* 50g pre-sliced cheese. I used Jarlsberg, similar types should work the same
* Spices

# Process
* Cut sliced cheese roughly into 1-1.5cm squares.
* Place cheese on a greaseproof paper covered tray spaced so none are touching.
* Heat oven to 80&deg;C and heat for 20-30 minutes until cheese is shimmering and melted.
* Remove tray from oven and increase heat to 180&deg;C, return cheese tray to oven when at temperature.
* Watch cheese until it starts to raise or pop, when this starts, set a timer for 5 minutes and remove when done.
* Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl with salt, pepper, garlic granules and any other herbs or spices you believe will work.
