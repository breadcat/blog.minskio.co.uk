Hi, my name's Peter.

This blog is a rambling and verbose journey into my interests, journeys, problems, solutions and stances.

* Hypermiling
* [INTJ Myersâ€“Briggs Indicator](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ef5f8da14ed9e)
* Left wing politics
* Lucid dreaming
* Minimalism and Stoicism
* Napping
* [Nordic language](/languages/) and culture

You'll likely find numerous typos, all pages are written without the use of a spell checker.
If you'd like to message me, my email address is incredibly easy to guess and probably listed on one of the above sites.
